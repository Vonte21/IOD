The interior is just beautiful.\\t1\\nSo they performed.\\t1\\nThat\\'s right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.\\t1\\n- They never brought a salad we asked for.\\t0\\nThis hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.\\t1\\nTook an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.\\t0\\nThe worst was the salmon sashimi.\\t0\\nAlso there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.\\t1\\nThis was like the final blow!\\t0\\nI found this place by accident and I could not be happier.\\t1\\nseems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.\\t0\\nOverall, I like this place a lot.\\t1\\nThe only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.\\t1\\nAmple portions and good prices.\\t1\\nPoor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.\\t0\\nMy first visit to Hiro was a delight!\\t1\\nService sucks.\\t0\\nThe shrimp tender and moist.\\t1\\nThere is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.\\t0\\nHard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn\\'t want to eat it for fear of getting sick.\\t0\\nOn a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.\\t1\\nFrozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.\\t0\\nThe only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.\\t1\\nIt\\'s too bad the food is so damn generic.\\t0\\nThe burger is good beef, cooked just right.\\t1\\nIf you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!\\t1\\nMy side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.\\t1\\nWe ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.\\t1\\nHe came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.\\t1\\nTheir chow mein is so good!\\t1\\nThey have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don\\'t enjoy their food.\\t0\\nThe portion was huge!\\t1\\nLoved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.\\t1\\nThe Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.\\t0\\nNot much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.\\t0\\nThe salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.\\t1\\nThe ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.\\t0\\nAt least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.\\t0\\nThis place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!\\t1\\nThe cocktails are all handmade and delicious.\\t1\\nWe\\'d definitely go back here again.\\t1\\nWe are so glad we found this place.\\t1\\nGreat food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.\\t1\\nAlways a great time at Dos Gringos!\\t1\\nUpdate.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing\\t1\\nWe got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.\\t0\\nA great way to finish a great.\\t1\\nThe deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.\\t1\\n- Really, really good rice, all the time.\\t1\\nThe service was meh.\\t0\\nIt took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.\\t0\\nI guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn\\'t use my common sense.\\t0\\nThe scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.\\t0\\n2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !\\t0\\nThe sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.\\t1\\nToday is the second time I\\'ve been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.\\t1\\nThere is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.\\t0\\nComing here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can\\'t wait for the other person to ask to break up.\\t0\\nwalked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.\\t0\\nThe turkey and roast beef were bland.\\t0\\nThis place has it!\\t1\\nThe pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.\\t0\\nI love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.\\t1\\nThe poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.\\t0\\nAll I have to say is the food was amazing!!!\\t1\\nOmelets are to die for!\\t1\\nEverything was fresh and delicious!\\t1\\nIn summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.\\t0\\nIt\\'s like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you\\'re outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.\\t1\\nNever been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!\\t0\\nBest breakfast buffet!!!\\t1\\nsay bye bye to your tip lady!\\t0\\nWe\\'ll never go again.\\t0\\nWill be back again!\\t1\\nFood arrived quickly!\\t1\\nIt was not good.\\t0\\nOn the up side, their cafe serves really good food.\\t1\\nOur server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!\\t1\\nThe only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary\\'s coming.\\t1\\nBest Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.\\t1\\nI LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.\\t1\\nThis is one of the better buffets that I have been to.\\t1\\nSo we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!\\t1\\nThe food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!\\t1\\nThe ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.\\t1\\nWill go back next trip out.\\t1\\nSooooo good!!\\t1\\nREAL sushi lovers, let\\'s be honest - Yama is not that good.\\t0\\nAt least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn\\'t that busy.\\t0\\nThis is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.\\t1\\nNice, spicy and tender.\\t1\\nGood prices.\\t1\\nCheck it out.\\t1\\nIt was pretty gross!\\t0\\nI\\'ve had better atmosphere.\\t0\\nKind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.\\t0\\nAlthough I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.\\t0\\nI just don\\'t know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.\\t0\\nWorst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.\\t0\\nService was fine and the waitress was friendly.\\t1\\nThe guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he\\'s ever eaten.\\t1\\nWe thought you\\'d have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.\\t1\\nHost staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!\\t0\\nBland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don\\'t want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I\\'ll leave it at that...\\t0\\nPhenomenal food, service and ambiance.\\t1\\nI wouldn\\'t return.\\t0\\nDefinitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I\\'m in Vegas.\\t1\\nThis place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.\\t0\\nPenne vodka excellent!\\t1\\nThey have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.\\t1\\nThe management is rude.\\t0\\nDelicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.\\t1\\nGreat Subway, in fact it\\'s so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.\\t1\\nI had a seriously solid breakfast here.\\t1\\nThis is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.\\t1\\nHe was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.\\t0\\nMy drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.\\t1\\nDon\\'t do it!!!!\\t0\\nThe waiter wasn\\'t helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.\\t0\\nMy husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.\\t0\\nAnd the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn\\'t very tasty to me.\\t0\\nNice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.\\t1\\nThe bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.\\t1\\nThe menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.\\t0\\nThe service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.\\t0\\nI give it 2 thumbs down\\t0\\nWe watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.\\t0\\nMy fiancÃ© and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.\\t1\\nThis is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.\\t1\\nWe waited for forty five minutes in vain.\\t0\\nCrostini that came with the salad was stale.\\t0\\nSome highlights : Great quality nigiri here!\\t1\\nthe staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.\\t1\\nthis was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.\\t1\\nI ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I\\'d had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.\\t1\\nthis place is good.\\t1\\nUnfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.\\t0\\nI came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.\\t0\\nI was seated immediately.\\t1\\nTheir menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.\\t1\\nAvoid at all cost!\\t0\\nRestaurant is always full but never a wait.\\t1\\nDELICIOUS!!\\t1\\nThis place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.\\t1\\nSo don\\'t go there if you are looking for good food...\\t0\\nI\\'ve never been treated so bad.\\t0\\nBacon is hella salty.\\t1\\nWe also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.\\t0\\nThis really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.\\t1\\nThe waitresses are very friendly.\\t1\\nLordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!\\t1\\nEverything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.\\t1\\nPerhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I\\'m not inspired to go back.\\t0\\nThe service here leaves a lot to be desired.\\t0\\nThe atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.\\t1\\nNot a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.\\t1\\nWe literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.\\t0\\nThe burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.\\t0\\nI also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.\\t0\\nI dressed up to be treated so rudely!\\t0\\nIt was probably dirt.\\t0\\nLove this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.\\t1\\nI ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.\\t1\\nThe food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.\\t0\\nInteresting decor.\\t1\\nWhat I really like there is the crepe station.\\t1\\nAlso were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.\\t1\\nyou can watch them preparing the delicious food!)\\t1\\nBoth of the egg rolls were fantastic.\\t1\\nWhen my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.\\t0\\nI had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.\\t1\\nI\\'m not really sure how Joey\\'s was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.\\t0\\nThe best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!\\t1\\nThe live music on Fridays totally blows.\\t0\\nI\\'ve never been more insulted or felt disrespected.\\t0\\nVery friendly staff.\\t1\\nIt is worth the drive.\\t1\\nI had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.\\t1\\nFood was great and so was the serivce!\\t1\\nThe warm beer didn\\'t help.\\t0\\nGreat brunch spot.\\t1\\nService is friendly and inviting.\\t1\\nVery good lunch spot.\\t1\\nI\\'ve lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I\\'ve stepped foot into this place.\\t0\\nThe WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.\\t0\\nMust have been an off night at this place.\\t0\\nThe sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.\\t1\\nIf that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.\\t0\\nFor about 10 minutes, we we\\'re waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn\\'t coming any time soon.\\t0\\nMy friend loved the salmon tartar.\\t1\\nWon\\'t go back.\\t0\\nExtremely Tasty!\\t1\\nWaitress was good though!\\t1\\nSoggy and not good.\\t0\\nThe Jamaican mojitos are delicious.\\t1\\nWhich are small and not worth the price.\\t0\\n- the food is rich so order accordingly.\\t1\\nThe shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don\\'t mind being nude for everyone to see!\\t0\\nThe service was a bit lacking.\\t0\\nLobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.\\t0\\nHopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.\\t0\\nIt was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.\\t0\\nI loved the bacon wrapped dates.\\t1\\nThis is an unbelievable BARGAIN!\\t1\\nThe folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.\\t1\\nAs for the \"mains,\" also uninspired.\\t0\\nThis is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!\\t1\\nThis wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.\\t1\\nIf the food isn\\'t bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world\\'s worst/annoying drunk people.\\t0\\nVery very fun chef.\\t1\\nOrdered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.\\t0\\nGreat place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV\\'s.\\t1\\nIf it were possible to give them zero stars, they\\'d have it.\\t0\\nThe descriptions said \"yum yum sauce\" and another said \"eel sauce\", yet another said \"spicy mayo\"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.\\t0\\nI\\'d say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M\\'s dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).\\t1\\nIf she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.\\t0\\nEveryone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.\\t1\\nHorrible - don\\'t waste your time and money.\\t0\\nNow this dish was quite flavourful.\\t1\\nBy this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.\\t0\\n(It wasn\\'t busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.\\t0\\nlike the other reviewer said \"you couldn\\'t pay me to eat at this place again.\"\\t0\\n-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.\\t0\\nSeriously flavorful delights, folks.\\t1\\nMuch better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.\\t1\\nThe lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.\\t1\\nBased on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won\\'t be going back.\\t0\\nOwner\\'s are really great people.!\\t1\\nThere is nothing privileged about working/eating there.\\t0\\nThe Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.\\t1\\nOverall, I don\\'t think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.\\t0\\nNow the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.\\t1\\nWe had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.\\t1\\nFantastic service here.\\t1\\nI as well would\\'ve given godfathers zero stars if possible.\\t0\\nThey know how to make them here.\\t1\\nvery tough and very short on flavor!\\t0\\nI hope this place sticks around.\\t1\\nI have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.\\t0\\nThe restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.\\t1\\nGood service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!\\t1\\nThe seafood was fresh and generous in portion.\\t1\\nPlus, it\\'s only 8 bucks.\\t1\\nThe service was not up to par, either.\\t0\\nThus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.\\t1\\nJust as good as when I had it more than a year ago!\\t1\\nFor a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.\\t0\\nThe Veggitarian platter is out of this world!\\t1\\nYou cant go wrong with any of the food here.\\t1\\nYou can\\'t beat that.\\t1\\nStopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.\\t1\\nThe chefs were friendly and did a good job.\\t1\\nI\\'ve had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.\\t0\\nI liked the patio and the service was outstanding.\\t1\\nThe goat taco didn\\'t skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!\\t1\\nI think not again\\t0\\nI had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.\\t0\\nI went to Bachi Burger on a friend\\'s recommendation and was not disappointed.\\t1\\nService stinks here!\\t0\\nI waited and waited.\\t0\\nThis place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.\\t0\\nI would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.\\t1\\nGreat Pizza and Salads!\\t1\\nThings that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.\\t0\\nWe waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.\\t0\\nThis place is amazing!\\t1\\nI hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.\\t0\\nWaited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!\\t0\\nJust don\\'t know why they were so slow.\\t0\\nThe staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.\\t1\\nI live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won\\'t be back here, because it is a convenient location.\\t0\\nI didn\\'t know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.\\t1\\nYou get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.\\t1\\nBefore I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.\\t0\\nI love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.\\t1\\nNever again will I be dining at this place!\\t0\\nThe food was excellent and service was very good.\\t1\\nGood beer & drink selection and good food selection.\\t1\\nPlease stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.\\t0\\nThe potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.\\t0\\nFood was really boring.\\t0\\nGood Service-check!\\t1\\nThis greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!\\t0\\nWill never, ever go back.\\t0\\nAs much as I\\'d like to go back, I can\\'t get passed the atrocious service and will never return.\\t0\\nIn the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.\\t1\\nI did not expect this to be so good!\\t1\\nFantastic food!\\t1\\nShe ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.\\t0\\nThe food was very good.\\t1\\nNever going back.\\t0\\nGreat food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.\\t1\\nThe bus boy on the other hand was so rude.\\t0\\nBy this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn\\'t mind making it publicly and loudly known.\\t0\\nBack to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.\\t1\\nAnd considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can\\'t go wrong.\\t1\\nAll the bread is made in-house!\\t1\\nThe only downside is the service.\\t0\\nAlso, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I\\'ve ever had.\\t0\\nService was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.\\t1\\nA couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.\\t1\\nFavorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!\\t1\\nThe black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!\\t1\\nYou won\\'t be disappointed.\\t1\\nThey could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.\\t1\\nI go to far too many places and I\\'ve never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.\\t0\\nWhen my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.\\t0\\nThe servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don\\'t always honor Pizza Hut coupons.\\t0\\nBoth of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.\\t1\\nWe had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.\\t1\\nEverything was gross.\\t0\\nI love this place.\\t1\\nGreat service and food.\\t1\\nFirst - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!\\t0\\nThe burger... I got the \"Gold Standard\" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.\\t0\\nOMG, the food was delicioso!\\t1\\nThere is nothing authentic about this place.\\t0\\nthe spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.\\t0\\nOf all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.\\t1\\nThe vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.\\t1\\nIt\\'s worth driving up from Tucson!\\t1\\nThe selection was probably the worst I\\'ve seen in Vegas.....there was none.\\t0\\nPretty good beer selection too.\\t1\\nThis place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.\\t1\\nClassy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!\\t1\\n5 stars for the brick oven bread app!\\t1\\nI have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.\\t1\\nWe sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.\\t0\\nHe was terrible!\\t0\\nEveryone is treated equally special.\\t1\\nIt shouldn\\'t take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.\\t0\\nIt was delicious!!!\\t1\\nOn the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.\\t1\\nSadly, Gordon Ramsey\\'s Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.\\t0\\nAs always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!\\t1\\nBest fish I\\'ve ever had in my life!\\t1\\n(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)\\t1\\nThe buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.\\t0\\nThis is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.\\t1\\nPretty cool I would say.\\t1\\nDefinitely a turn off for me & i doubt I\\'ll be back unless someone else is buying.\\t0\\nServer did a great job handling our large rowdy table.\\t1\\nI find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn\\'t food.\\t0\\nMy wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.\\t0\\nWould come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.\\t1\\nThe staff are great, the ambiance is great.\\t1\\nHe deserves 5 stars.\\t1\\nI left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.\\t0\\nThey dropped more than the ball.\\t0\\nThe dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.\\t1\\nThey will customize your order any way you\\'d like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!\\t1\\nAnd the beans and rice were mediocre at best.\\t0\\nBest tacos in town by far!!\\t1\\nI took back my money and got outta there.\\t0\\nIn an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.\\t1\\nRUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.\\t0\\nThe staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.\\t0\\nI won\\'t be back.\\t0\\nThey have great dinners.\\t1\\nThe service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.\\t1\\nThe food was terrible.\\t0\\nWILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.\\t0\\nI don\\'t recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.\\t0\\nI will come back here every time I\\'m in Vegas.\\t1\\nThis place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.\\t0\\nThis is a disgrace.\\t0\\nDef coming back to bowl next time\\t1\\nIf you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.\\t1\\nI will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;\\t1\\nI have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.\\t1\\nWe walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.\\t1\\nService was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.\\t1\\nTo summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.\\t1\\nI\\'m probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.\\t0\\nKids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!\\t1\\nService is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.\\t1\\nCooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.\\t1\\nThis one is simply a disappointment.\\t0\\nOverall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.\\t0\\nI don\\'t have to be an accountant to know I\\'m getting screwed!\\t0\\nGreat place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.\\t1\\nToday was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.\\t1\\nLeft very frustrated.\\t0\\nI\\'ll definitely be in soon again.\\t1\\nFood was really good and I got full petty fast.\\t1\\nService was fantastic.\\t1\\nTOTAL WASTE OF TIME.\\t0\\nI don\\'t know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.\\t1\\nCome hungry, leave happy and stuffed!\\t1\\nFor service, I give them no stars.\\t0\\nI can assure you that you won\\'t be disappointed.\\t1\\nI can take a little bad service but the food sucks.\\t0\\nGave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).\\t0\\nBut now I was completely grossed out.\\t0\\nI really enjoyed eating here.\\t1\\nFirst time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.\\t1\\nOur server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.\\t1\\nFrom what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.\\t1\\nOn the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.\\t0\\nFurthermore, you can\\'t even find hours of operation on the website!\\t0\\nWe\\'ve tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we\\'re done with them.\\t0\\nWhat a mistake that was!\\t0\\nNo complaints!\\t1\\nThis is some seriously good pizza and I\\'m an expert/connisseur on the topic.\\t1\\nWaiter was a jerk.\\t0\\nStrike 2, who wants to be rushed.\\t0\\nThese are the nicest restaurant owners I\\'ve ever come across.\\t1\\nI never come again.\\t0\\nWe loved the biscuits!!!\\t1\\nService is quick and friendly.\\t1\\nOrdered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.\\t0\\nSo absolutley fantastic.\\t1\\nIt was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.\\t0\\ndefinitely will come back here again.\\t1\\nI like Steiners because it\\'s dark and it feels like a bar.\\t1\\nWow very spicy but delicious.\\t1\\nIf you\\'re not familiar, check it out.\\t1\\nI\\'ll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.\\t0\\nI\\'d love to go back.\\t1\\nAnyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.\\t1\\nNothing special.\\t0\\nEach day of the week they have a different deal and it\\'s all so delicious!\\t1\\nNot to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!\\t1\\nWill not be back.\\t0\\nSauce was tasteless.\\t0\\nThe food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.\\t1\\nMy ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.\\t1\\nI don\\'t think we\\'ll be going back anytime soon.\\t0\\nFood was so gooodd.\\t1\\nI am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.\\t0\\nI was so insulted.\\t0\\nThe last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.\\t0\\nThe chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.\\t0\\nThe food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.\\t1\\nNargile - I think you are great.\\t1\\nBest tater tots in the southwest.\\t1\\nWe loved the place.\\t1\\nDefinitely not worth the $3 I paid.\\t0\\nThe vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.\\t1\\nIm in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.\\t1\\nThe manager was the worst.\\t0\\nThe inside is really quite nice and very clean.\\t1\\nThe food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.\\t1\\nI don\\'t think I\\'ll be running back to Carly\\'s anytime soon for food.\\t0\\nThis is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.\\t0\\nLove the margaritas, too!\\t1\\nThis was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.\\t1\\nVery good, though!\\t1\\nThe one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.\\t0\\nGreat pork sandwich.\\t1\\nDon\\'t waste your time here.\\t0\\nTotal letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.\\t0\\nThird, the cheese on my friend\\'s burger was cold.\\t0\\nWe enjoy their pizza and brunch.\\t1\\nThe steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.\\t1\\nWe had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.\\t1\\nI LOVED it!\\t1\\nWe asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn\\'t bring that either.\\t0\\nThis place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I\\'ve been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.\\t1\\nSeafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.\\t0\\nThe selection of food was not the best.\\t0\\nDelicious and I will absolutely be back!\\t1\\nThis isn\\'t a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.\\t1\\nThey had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.\\t1\\nI dont think I will be back for a very long time.\\t0\\nIt was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.\\t0\\nHow awesome is that.\\t1\\nI will be back many times soon.\\t1\\nThe menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!\\t1\\nWorse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.\\t0\\nCONCLUSION: Very filling meals.\\t1\\nTheir daily specials are always a hit with my group.\\t1\\nAnd then tragedy struck.\\t0\\nThe pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.\\t1\\nThis was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!\\t1\\nTheir monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.\\t1\\nWaitress was sweet and funny.\\t1\\nI also had to taste my Mom\\'s multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!\\t1\\nI\\'d rather eat airline food, seriously.\\t0\\nCant say enough good things about this place.\\t1\\nThe ambiance was incredible.\\t1\\nThe waitress and manager are so friendly.\\t1\\nI would not recommend this place.\\t0\\nOverall I wasn\\'t very impressed with Noca.\\t0\\nMy gyro was basically lettuce only.\\t0\\nTerrible service!\\t0\\nThoroughly disappointed!\\t0\\nI don\\'t each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.\\t1\\nGive it a try, you will be happy you did.\\t1\\nBy far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!\\t1\\nReasonably priced also!\\t1\\nEverything was perfect the night we were in.\\t1\\nThe food is very good for your typical bar food.\\t1\\nit was a drive to get there.\\t0\\nAt first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.\\t1\\nAnyway, I do not think i will go back there.\\t0\\nPoint your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won\\'t be disappointed.\\t1\\nOh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.\\t1\\nIf you haven\\'t gone here GO NOW!\\t1\\nA greasy, unhealthy meal.\\t0\\nfirst time there and might just be the last.\\t0\\nThose burgers were amazing.\\t1\\nSimilarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.\\t0\\nAnd it was way to expensive.\\t0\\nBe sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.\\t1\\nThis was my first time and I can\\'t wait until the next.\\t1\\nThe bartender was also nice.\\t1\\nEverything was good and tasty!\\t1\\nThis place is two thumbs up....way up.\\t1\\nThe best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.\\t1\\nIf you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.\\t1\\nTerrible management.\\t0\\nAn excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.\\t1\\nIf there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.\\t0\\nGreat steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.\\t1\\nWorst martini ever!\\t0\\nThe steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.\\t1\\nI had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!\\t1\\nWe waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).\\t0\\nThe yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.\\t1\\nI won\\'t try going back there even if it\\'s empty.\\t0\\nNo, I\\'m going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.\\t0\\nJust spicy enough.. Perfect actually.\\t1\\nLast night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!\\t1\\nnot even a \"hello, we will be right with you.\"\\t0\\nThe desserts were a bit strange.\\t0\\nMy boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.\\t1\\nI really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!\\t1\\nNice ambiance.\\t1\\nI would recommend saving room for this!\\t1\\nI guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.\\t0\\nHowever, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.\\t0\\nI know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!\\t0\\nAVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!\\t0\\nI think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.\\t0\\nAll of the tapas dishes were delicious!\\t1\\nI *heart* this place.\\t1\\nMy salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.\\t0\\nAfter two I felt disgusting.\\t0\\nA good time!\\t1\\nI believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.\\t1\\nGenerous portions and great taste.\\t1\\nI will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!\\t0\\nThe servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an \"Are you being helped?\"\\t0\\nFood was delicious!\\t1\\nAN HOUR... seriously?\\t0\\nI consider this theft.\\t0\\nEew... This location needs a complete overhaul.\\t0\\nWe recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.\\t0\\nWaited and waited and waited.\\t0\\nHe also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.\\t1\\nOur server was super nice and checked on us many times.\\t1\\nThe pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.\\t0\\nI swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.\\t0\\nService was good and the company was better!\\t1\\nThe staff are also very friendly and efficient.\\t1\\nAs for the service: I\\'m a fan, because it\\'s quick and you\\'re being served by some nice folks.\\t1\\nBoy was that sucker dry!!.\\t0\\nOver rated.\\t0\\nIf you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.\\t0\\nTheir steaks are 100% recommended!\\t1\\nAfter I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.\\t0\\nGreat food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.\\t1\\nAll in all, I can assure you I\\'ll be back.\\t1\\nI hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.\\t0\\nMy breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.\\t1\\nThe kids play area is NASTY!\\t0\\nGreat place fo take out or eat in.\\t1\\nThe waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.\\t1\\nOMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.\\t1\\nIt was extremely \"crumby\" and pretty tasteless.\\t0\\nIt was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.\\t0\\nThe croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.\\t1\\nI got home to see the driest damn wings ever!\\t0\\nIt\\'ll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!\\t1\\nI really enjoyed Crema CafÃ© before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.\\t1\\nNot good for the money.\\t0\\nI miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!\\t1\\nWe got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.\\t0\\nThey also have the best cheese crisp in town.\\t1\\nGood value, great food, great service.\\t1\\nCouldn\\'t ask for a more satisfying meal.\\t1\\nThe food is good.\\t1\\nIt was awesome.\\t1\\nI just wanted to leave.\\t0\\nWe made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!\\t1\\nI will not be eating there again.\\t0\\n!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!\\t0\\nI checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.\\t0\\nThe chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.\\t0\\nSorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(\\t0\\nAn absolute must visit!\\t1\\nThe cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.\\t1\\nMy friend did not like his Bloody Mary.\\t0\\nDespite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.\\t0\\nThey really want to make your experience a good one.\\t1\\nI will not return.\\t0\\nI had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.\\t0\\nVery disappointing!!!\\t0\\nThe grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.\\t1\\na drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.\\t0\\nPretty awesome place.\\t1\\nAmbience is perfect.\\t1\\nBest of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.\\t0\\nAny grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.\\t0\\nI asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.\\t0\\nThe staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!\\t1\\nFour stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !\\t1\\nThe roast beef sandwich tasted really good!\\t1\\nSame evening, him and I are both drastically sick.\\t0\\nHigh-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.\\t1\\nOrdered burger rare came in we\\'ll done.\\t0\\nWe were promptly greeted and seated.\\t1\\nTried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.\\t0\\nI was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.\\t1\\nAfter waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.\\t0\\nThis is a good joint.\\t1\\nThe Macarons here are insanely good.\\t1\\nI\\'m not eating here!\\t0\\nOur waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.\\t1\\nMaybe if they weren\\'t cold they would have been somewhat edible.\\t0\\nThis place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.\\t0\\nVery bad Experience!\\t0\\nWhat a mistake.\\t0\\nFood was average at best.\\t0\\nGreat food.\\t1\\nWe won\\'t be going back anytime soon!\\t0\\nVery Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.\\t0\\nGreat place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.\\t1\\nIt is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.\\t1\\nNot much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.\\t0\\nThe patio seating was very comfortable.\\t1\\nThe fried rice was dry as well.\\t0\\nHands down my favorite Italian restaurant!\\t1\\nThat just SCREAMS \"LEGIT\" in my book...somethat\\'s also pretty rare here in Vegas.\\t1\\nIt was just not a fun experience.\\t1\\nThe atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.\\t1\\nI personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it\\'s amazing what they do with eggplant!).\\t1\\nVery convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!\\t1\\nThe owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.\\t1\\nBoth great!\\t1\\nEclectic selection.\\t1\\nThe sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.\\t1\\nThe staff was very attentive.\\t1\\nAnd the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).\\t1\\nThe owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.\\t1\\nGoogle mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.\\t0\\ndont go here.\\t0\\nI promise they won\\'t disappoint.\\t1\\nAs a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.\\t0\\nWhat a great double cheeseburger!\\t1\\nAwesome service and food.\\t1\\nA fantastic neighborhood gem !!!\\t1\\nI can\\'t wait to go back.\\t1\\nThe plantains were the worst I\\'ve ever tasted.\\t0\\nIt\\'s a great place and I highly recommend it.\\t1\\nService was slow and not attentive.\\t0\\nI gave it 5 stars then, and I\\'m giving it 5 stars now.\\t1\\nYour staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.\\t0\\nDessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.\\t1\\nVery good food, great atmosphere.1\\t1\\nDamn good steak.\\t1\\nTotal brunch fail.\\t0\\nPrices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.\\t1\\nThe decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.\\t1\\nThe steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!\\t1\\nGood food , good service .\\t1\\nIt was absolutely amazing.\\t1\\nI probably won\\'t be back, to be honest.\\t0\\nwill definitely be back!\\t1\\nThe sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.\\t1\\nHawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I\\'ve tried so far and they\\'re all good.\\t1\\nWent for lunch - service was slow.\\t0\\nWe had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.\\t0\\nI was mortified.\\t0\\nNeedless to say, we will never be back here again.\\t0\\nAnyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.\\t0\\nThe chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.\\t0\\nI wasn\\'t really impressed with Strip Steak.\\t0\\nHave been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!\\t1\\nOur server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.\\t1\\nThe cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.\\t1\\nI work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.\\t0\\nThe atmosphere here is fun.\\t1\\nWould not recommend to others.\\t0\\nService is quick and even \"to go\" orders are just like we like it!\\t1\\nI mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it\\'s so terrible!?!\\t0\\nThat said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.\\t1\\nNot my thing.\\t0\\n2 Thumbs Up!!\\t1\\nIf you are reading this please don\\'t go there.\\t0\\nI loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.\\t1\\nOnly Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!\\t1\\nThey have a really nice atmosphere.\\t1\\nTonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.\\t0\\nAfter one bite, I was hooked.\\t1\\nWe ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.\\t0\\nCute, quaint, simple, honest.\\t1\\nThe chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.\\t1\\nThe food was great as always, compliments to the chef.\\t1\\nSpecial thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.\\t1\\nAwesome selection of beer.\\t1\\nGreat food and awesome service!\\t1\\nOne nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn\\'t expect more tip than that.\\t1\\nA FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!\\t0\\nThe Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.\\t1\\nAs for the service, I thought it was good.\\t1\\nThe food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.\\t0\\nRyan\\'s Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won\\'t be revisiting.\\t0\\nNicest Chinese restaurant I\\'ve been in a while.\\t1\\nOverall, I like there food and the service.\\t1\\nThey also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.\\t1\\nProbably never coming back, and wouldn\\'t recommend it.\\t0\\nFriend\\'s pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.\\t0\\nTry them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.\\t1\\nI love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.\\t1\\nNever had anything to complain about here.\\t1\\nThe restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.\\t1\\nIt was way over fried.\\t0\\nI\\'m not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.\\t0\\nWhen I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.\\t0\\nWill not be back!\\t0\\nThere was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.\\t1\\nAn extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.\\t1\\nI always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.\\t1\\nI have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!\\t0\\nWonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.\\t1\\nI got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.\\t1\\nThe wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.\\t1\\nLevel 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn\\'t over-whelm the soup.\\t1\\nWe were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!\\t1\\nMain thing I didn\\'t enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.\\t0\\nWhen I\\'m on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I\\'ll hit up again!\\t1\\nI had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.\\t0\\nThis is a GREAT place to eat!\\t1\\nThe jalapeno bacon is soooo good.\\t1\\nThe service was poor and thats being nice.\\t0\\nFood was good, service was good, Prices were good.\\t1\\nThe place was not clean and the food oh so stale!\\t0\\nThe chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.\\t0\\nBut the service was beyond bad.\\t0\\nI\\'m so happy to be here!!!\"\\t1\\nTasted like dirt.\\t0\\nOne of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .\\t1\\nThe block was amazing.\\t1\\nIt\\'s close to my house, it\\'s low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.\\t1\\n* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!\\t1\\nMy sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.\\t0\\nGreat time - family dinner on a Sunday night.\\t1\\nthe food is not tasty at all, not to say its \"real traditional Hunan style\".\\t0\\nWhat did bother me, was the slow service.\\t0\\nThe flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!\\t1\\nTheir frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.\\t0\\nThese were so good we ordered them twice.\\t1\\nSo in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.\\t0\\nMy girlfriend\\'s veal was very bad.\\t0\\nUnfortunately, it was not good.\\t0\\nI had a pretty satifying experience.\\t1\\nJoin the club and get awesome offers via email.\\t1\\nPerfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.\\t1\\nBland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.\\t0\\nThe chains, which I\\'m no fan of, beat this place easily.\\t0\\nThe nachos are a MUST HAVE!\\t1\\nWe will not be coming back.\\t0\\nI don\\'t have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.\\t1\\nThe staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.\\t1\\nGreat atmosphere, friendly and fast service.\\t1\\nWhen I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.\\t1\\nOnce your food arrives it\\'s meh.\\t0\\nPaying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid\\'s meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.\\t0\\nThe classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.\\t1\\nMy brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.\\t0\\nSo good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.\\t1\\nThe chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.\\t1\\nThis place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\t1\\nMediocre food.\\t0\\nOnce you get inside you\\'ll be impressed with the place.\\t1\\nI\\'m super pissd.\\t0\\nAnd service was super friendly.\\t1\\nWhy are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?\\t0\\nThis place was such a nice surprise!\\t1\\nThey were golden-crispy and delicious.\\t1\\nI had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.\\t0\\nI could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.\\t1\\nNot a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.\\t0\\nLastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.\\t1\\nThe first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.\\t1\\nThe server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!\\t0\\nThe service was terrible though.\\t0\\nThis place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!\\t0\\nIt was packed!!\\t0\\nI love this place.\\t1\\nI can say that the desserts were yummy.\\t1\\nThe food was terrible.\\t0\\nThe seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.\\t1\\nIt kept getting worse and worse so now I\\'m officially done.\\t0\\nThis place should honestly be blown up.\\t0\\nBut I definitely would not eat here again.\\t0\\nDo not waste your money here!\\t0\\nI love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.\\t1\\nThe crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist.\\t1\\nAwful service.\\t0\\nWon\\'t ever go here again.\\t0\\nFood quality has been horrible.\\t0\\nFor that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.\\t0\\nThe service here is fair at best.\\t0\\nI do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.\\t0\\nDo yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.\\t0\\nVery poor service.\\t0\\nNo one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.\\t0\\nBest service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.\\t1\\nThey were excellent.\\t1\\nI paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.\\t0\\nJust had lunch here and had a great experience.\\t1\\nI have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.\\t0\\nFood is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.\\t0\\nI recently tried Caballero\\'s and I have been back every week since!\\t1\\nfor 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.\\t0\\nThe food came out at a good pace.\\t1\\nI ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.\\t1\\nI won\\'t be back.\\t0\\nWe could not believe how dirty the oysters were!\\t0\\nThis place deserves no stars.\\t0\\nI would not recommend this place.\\t0\\nIn fact I\\'m going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.\\t1\\nTo my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.\\t0\\nBad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!\\t0\\nthe potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.\\t1\\nI probably would not go here again.\\t0\\nSo flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.\\t1\\nThe price is reasonable and the service is great.\\t1\\nThe Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.\\t0\\nMy fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn\\'t look too appealing.\\t0\\nWent in for happy hour, great list of wines.\\t1\\nSome may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!\\t1\\nI probably won\\'t be coming back here.\\t0\\nWorst food/service I\\'ve had in a while.\\t0\\nThis place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.\\t1\\nTalk about great customer service of course we will be back.\\t1\\nHot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.\\t0\\nI love their fries and their beans.\\t1\\nAlways a pleasure dealing with him.\\t1\\nThey have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I\\'ve tried gets my seal of approval.\\t1\\nThis place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.\\t1\\nFor sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.\\t1\\nThe service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.\\t1\\nThe feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.\\t0\\nI started this review with two stars, but I\\'m editing it to give it only one.\\t0\\nthis is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco\\'s.\\t0\\nAll in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.\\t1\\nMy boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.\\t1\\nWeird vibe from owners.\\t0\\nThere was hardly any meat.\\t0\\nI\\'ve had better bagels from the grocery store.\\t0\\nGo To Place for Gyros.\\t1\\nI love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!\\t1\\nNow the burgers aren\\'t as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.\\t0\\nI found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.\\t0\\nThe service was terrible, food was mediocre.\\t0\\nWe definately enjoyed ourselves.\\t1\\nI ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.\\t0\\nOn three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.\\t0\\nI had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.\\t0\\nThe service was extremely slow.\\t0\\nAfter 20 minutes wait, I got a table.\\t0\\nSeriously killer hot chai latte.\\t1\\nNo allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.\\t0\\nMy boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.\\t1\\nTheir rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.\\t1\\nPricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.\\t0\\nWorst Thai ever.\\t0\\nIf you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.\\t1\\nI want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.\\t1\\nThe pizza selections are good.\\t1\\nI had strawberry tea, which was good.\\t1\\nHighly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!\\t0\\nOverall, a great experience.\\t1\\nSpend your money elsewhere.\\t0\\nTheir regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!\\t1\\nThe Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.\\t0\\nAnd the drinks are WEAK, people!\\t0\\n-My order was not correct.\\t0\\nAlso, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.\\t0\\nAfter the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.\\t0\\nThe chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\t1\\nWe won\\'t be returning.\\t0\\nThis is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.\\t1\\nI seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.\\t0\\nVery, very sad.\\t0\\ni felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?\\t0\\nHow can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can\\'t properly cook a steak, I don\\'t understand!\\t0\\nI\\'m not impressed with the concept or the food.\\t0\\nThe only thing I wasn\\'t too crazy about was their guacamole as I don\\'t like it purÃ©ed.\\t0\\nThere is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better\\t0\\nI got food poisoning here at the buffet.\\t0\\nThey brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!\\t0\\nWhat SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.\\t0\\nNeedless to say, I won\\'t be going back anytime soon.\\t0\\nThis place is disgusting!\\t0\\nEvery time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.\\t1\\nThe RI style calamari was a joke.\\t0\\nHowever, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.\\t0\\nI could barely stomach the meal, but didn\\'t complain because it was a business lunch.\\t0\\nIt was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.\\t0\\nIt also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.\\t0\\nWe aren\\'t ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don\\'t get it...definitely lost the love after this one!\\t0\\nDisappointing experience.\\t0\\nThe food is about on par with Denny\\'s, which is to say, not good at all.\\t0\\nIf you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.\\t0\\nWAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.\\t0\\nWe won\\'t be going back.\\t0\\nThe place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn\\'t worth it.\\t0\\nThis place lacked style!!\\t0\\nThe sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.\\t0\\nDon\\'t bother coming here.\\t0\\nThe meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.\\t0\\nThe building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn\\'t eat here again.\\t0\\nIt was equally awful.\\t0\\nProbably not in a hurry to go back.\\t0\\nvery slow at seating even with reservation.\\t0\\nNot good by any stretch of the imagination.\\t0\\nThe cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.\\t0\\nThe chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.\\t0\\nIt was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.\\t0\\nI was VERY disappointed!!\\t0\\nThis place is horrible and way overpriced.\\t0\\nMaybe it\\'s just their Vegetarian fare, but I\\'ve been twice and I thought it was average at best.\\t0\\nIt wasn\\'t busy at all and now we know why.\\t0\\nThe tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.\\t0\\nThe ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.\\t0\\nCon: spotty service.\\t0\\nThe fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.\\t0\\nBut then they came back cold.\\t0\\nThen our food came out, disappointment ensued.\\t0\\nThe real disappointment was our waiter.\\t0\\nMy husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.\\t0\\nThe only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.\\t0\\nInsults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.\\t0\\nIf someone orders two tacos don\\'t\\' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?\\t0\\nShe was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.\\t0\\nAfter all the rave reviews I couldn\\'t wait to eat here......what a disappointment!\\t0\\nDel Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.\\t0\\nIt\\'s NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.\\t0\\nBut I don\\'t like it.\\t0\\nHell no will I go back\\t0\\nWe\\'ve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.\\t0\\nI don\\'t know what the big deal is about this place, but I won\\'t be back \"ya\\'all\".\\t0\\nI immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.\\t0\\nThe ambiance isn\\'t much better.\\t0\\nUnfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.\\t0\\nThe food wasn\\'t good.\\t0\\nYour servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.\\t0\\nWhat happened next was pretty....off putting.\\t0\\ntoo bad cause I know it\\'s family owned, I really wanted to like this place.\\t0\\nOverpriced for what you are getting.\\t0\\nI vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.\\t0\\nI kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.\\t0\\nI have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.\\t0\\nWe started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn\\'t fresh.\\t0\\nFood was below average.\\t0\\nIt sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.\\t0\\nAll in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.\\t0\\nThe problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).\\t0\\nShrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.\\t0\\nIt lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.\\t0\\nIt really is impressive that the place hasn\\'t closed down.\\t0\\nI would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.\\t0\\nThe refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.\\t0\\nSpend your money and time some place else.\\t0\\nA lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.\\t0\\nthe presentation of the food was awful.\\t0\\nI can\\'t tell you how disappointed I was.\\t0\\nI think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.\\t0\\nAppetite instantly gone.\\t0\\nOverall I was not impressed and would not go back.\\t0\\nThe whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we\\'ll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.\\t0\\nThen, as if I hadn\\'t wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.\\t0\\n'"

       "\"A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  \\t0\\nNot sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  \\t0\\nAttempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  \\t0\\nVery little music or anything to speak of.  \\t0\\nThe best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  \\t1\\nThe rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  \\t0\\nWasted two hours.  \\t0\\nSaw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  \\t1\\nA bit predictable.  \\t0\\nLoved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  \\t1\\nAnd those baby owls were adorable.  \\t1\\nThe movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  \\t1\\nThe Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  \\t1\\nIt Was So Cool.  \\t1\\nThis is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  \\t1\\nIt had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  \\t0\\nThis review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  \\t1\\nI'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  \\t1\\nIt's practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces.  \\t1\\n The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  \\t1\\nI can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  \\t1\\nIn other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  \\t1\\nHow can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  \\t1\\nIt's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  \\t1\\nYes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  \\t1\\nThis short film certainly pulls no punches.  \\t0\\nGraphics is far from the best part of the game.  \\t0\\nThis is the number one best TH game in the series.  \\t1\\nIt deserves strong love.  \\t1\\nIt is an insane game.  \\t1\\nThere are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  \\t1\\nWaste your money on this game.  \\t1\\nThis is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  \\t1\\nActually, the graphics were good at the time.  \\t1\\nToday the graphics are crap.  \\t0\\nAs they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  \\t1\\nThis game rocks.  \\t1\\nBuy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  \\t1\\nIt's PURE BRILLIANCE.  \\t1\\nThis was a flick doomed from its conception.  \\t0\\nThe very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  \\t0\\nI wasn't the least bit interested.  \\t0\\nNot only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  \\t0\\nBut it's just not funny.  \\t0\\nBut even the talented Carrell can't save this.  \\t0\\nHis co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  \\t0\\nThe story itself is just predictable and lazy.  \\t0\\nThe only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  \\t0\\nBut whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  \\t0\\nThe film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  \\t1\\nI'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  \\t1\\nIn addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  \\t1\\nIt's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  \\t1\\nOn the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  \\t0\\nLong, whiny and pointless.  \\t0\\nBut I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  \\t0\\nExcellent cast, story line, performances.  \\t1\\nTotally believable.  \\t1\\nAnne Heche was utterly convincing.  \\t1\\nSam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  \\t1\\nI sat riveted to the TV screen.  \\t1\\nAll in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  \\t1\\nI do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  \\t1\\nI enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  \\t1\\nI was very disappointed in the movie.  \\t0\\nOne character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  \\t0\\nThere is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  \\t0\\nThere was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  \\t0\\nThis movie totally grates on my nerves.  \\t0\\nThe performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  \\t0\\nAnd, quite honestly, often its not very good.  \\t0\\nOften the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  \\t0\\nIt crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  \\t0\\nThere are some generally great things in it.  \\t1\\nI wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  \\t0\\nThe suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  \\t1\\nI especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  \\t1\\nIf you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  \\t1\\nAlexander Nevsky is a great film.  \\t1\\nHe is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  \\t1\\nI'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of QuÃ©bec.  \\t0\\nThis if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  \\t1\\nIf there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  \\t1\\nOverall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  \\t1\\nPlus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  \\t1\\nGive this one a look.  \\t1\\nI gave it a 10  \\t1\\nThe Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  \\t1\\nIt is a true classic.  \\t1\\nIt actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  \\t1\\nDefinitely worth checking out.  \\t1\\nThe problem was the script.  \\t0\\nIt was horrendous.  \\t0\\nThere was NOTHING believable about it at all.  \\t0\\nThe only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  \\t0\\nMANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  \\t1\\nThe scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  \\t1\\nThe cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  \\t1\\nUrsula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  \\t1\\nIf you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of The Way You Look Tonight), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  \\t1\\nI don't think you will be disappointed.  \\t1\\nFrankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  \\t0\\nThe acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  \\t0\\nIt was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  \\t0\\nToo politically correct.  \\t0\\nVery disappointing.  \\t0\\nThe only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  \\t1\\nI love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  \\t0\\nAn hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  \\t0\\nBut in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  \\t1\\nThe acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  \\t1\\nThe directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  \\t0\\nThe movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  \\t0\\n), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  \\t0\\nThe directing seems too pretentious.  \\t0\\nThe scenes with the oh-so-mature neighbour-girl are a misplace.  \\t0\\nAnd generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  \\t0\\nThen scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  \\t0\\nSome applause should be given to the prelude however.  \\t1\\nI really liked that.  \\t1\\nA great film by a great director.  \\t1\\nThe movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  \\t1\\nThe music in the film is really nice too.  \\t1\\nI'd advise anyone to go and see it.  \\t1\\nBrilliant!  \\t1\\n10/10  \\t1\\nI liked this movie way too much.  \\t1\\nMy only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  \\t0\\nIt rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  \\t1\\nHowever, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  \\t0\\nThere was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  \\t0\\nThere were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  \\t0\\nThis was a poor remake of My Best Friends Wedding.  \\t0\\nAll in all, a great disappointment.  \\t0\\nI cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film.  \\t0\\nI could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  \\t0\\nI guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  \\t0\\nIMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  \\t0\\nI saw Mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  \\t0\\nUnfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  \\t0\\nThese are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  \\t0\\nAll the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  \\t0\\nIt is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  \\t0\\nYou can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  \\t0\\nThis is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  \\t1\\nThis movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  \\t0\\nThe fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  \\t0\\nA truly, truly bad film.  \\t0\\nThe acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  \\t0\\nThe only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  \\t0\\nI paid too much.  \\t0\\nAlso, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  \\t1\\nIt was so BORING!  \\t0\\nNo plot whatsoever!  \\t0\\nAgain, no plot at all.  \\t0\\nHorrible!  \\t0\\nWorst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  \\t0\\nI had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  \\t0\\nI hate movies like that.  \\t0\\nYeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  \\t0\\nTHERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  \\t0\\nIf you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  \\t0\\nAwful.  \\t0\\nI don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  \\t0\\nIt was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  \\t0\\nNOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  \\t0\\nThis is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  \\t0\\nCrash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  \\t0\\nStill, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  \\t1\\nYour brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  \\t0\\nI was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  \\t0\\nThis movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  \\t0\\nI certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  \\t0\\nI mean this in a terrible way.  \\t0\\nThis film has no redeeming features.  \\t0\\nEverything is appalling.  \\t0\\nArtless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  \\t0\\nThe story is beyond stupid.  \\t0\\nThe script isÂ…was there a script?  \\t0\\nThe kids are annoying.  \\t0\\nThe lead man is charisma-free.  \\t0\\nUtterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  \\t0\\nI'll even say it again Â– this is torture.  \\t0\\nMaybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  \\t0\\nNot a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  \\t0\\nHighly unrecommended.  \\t0\\nIf this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  \\t0\\nYes, it's that bad.  \\t0\\nNothing at all to recommend.  \\t0\\nAn excellent performance from Ms.  \\t1\\nGarbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  \\t1\\nIt's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  \\t1\\nThis movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  \\t0\\nThere were too many close ups.  \\t0\\nBut other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  \\t0\\nBut this movie is definitely a below average rent.  \\t0\\nYou'll love it!  \\t1\\nThis movie is BAD.  \\t0\\nSo bad.  \\t0\\nThe film is way too long.  \\t0\\nThis is definitely one of the bad ones.  \\t0\\nThe movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  \\t1\\nJohn Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  \\t1\\nHis on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  \\t1\\nI think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  \\t1\\nI really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  \\t0\\nI don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  \\t0\\nIt probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  \\t0\\nAnother thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  \\t0\\nJamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  \\t1\\nHis performance is simply genius.  \\t1\\nHe owns the film, just as Spacek owned Coal Miner's Daughter and Quaid owned Great Balls of Fire.  \\t1\\n In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  \\t1\\nRay Charles is legendary.  \\t1\\nRay Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  \\t1\\nHitchcock is a great director.  \\t1\\nIronically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  \\t0\\nSecondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  \\t1\\nIt's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  \\t0\\nHence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  \\t0\\nThe plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  \\t0\\nThere are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  \\t0\\nMishima is extremely uninteresting.  \\t0\\nThis is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  \\t0\\nThe flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  \\t0\\nAnd the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  \\t0\\nHe can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  \\t0\\nSchrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  \\t0\\nWhen I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  \\t1\\nI was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  \\t1\\nHowever, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  \\t0\\nI mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  \\t0\\nThe character developments also lacked in depth.  \\t0\\nWoa, talk about awful.  \\t0\\nDo not waste your time.  \\t0\\nIt was just too horrible.  \\t0\\nThe worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  \\t0\\nBut what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  \\t0\\nThe poor actors.  \\t0\\nYou can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  \\t0\\nIf you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  \\t0\\nThis would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  \\t0\\nIf good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  \\t1\\nThe film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  \\t1\\nRegrettably, the film fails.  \\t0\\nThe movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  \\t0\\nNo actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  \\t0\\nYet, I enjoy watching it.  \\t1\\nUnfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  \\t0\\nBad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  \\t0\\nThe dialogue sucked.  \\t0\\nThe cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  \\t0\\nThe soundtrack sucked.  \\t0\\nThe acting sucked.  \\t0\\nThe concert sequences just sucked.  \\t0\\nThat was nice.  \\t1\\nThat was funny.  \\t1\\nIt was so funny.  \\t1\\nOverall, this movie was cheap trash.  \\t0\\nBut this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  \\t0\\nI came out of it feeling angry.  \\t0\\n***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  \\t1\\nThe cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  \\t1\\nConceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  \\t1\\nAnd there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  \\t1\\nAll things considered, a job very well done.  \\t1\\nThanks good a movie like this was done and released.  \\t1\\nOne of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  \\t1\\nIt ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  \\t1\\nThe attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  \\t1\\nIt is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  \\t1\\nUp there with the best of Melville.  \\t1\\nEverything about this film is simply incredible.  \\t1\\nYou truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  \\t1\\nBLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  \\t1\\nThe performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  \\t1\\nI thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  \\t1\\nI'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  \\t0\\nIf it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  \\t0\\nThere is a lot of beautiful places.  \\t1\\nIt was forced, like everything in this movie.  \\t0\\nAgain, lame.  \\t0\\nHere's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  \\t0\\nAnd don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  \\t0\\nWhen I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  \\t0\\nSummary: The witticisms weren't witty.  \\t0\\nThe plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  \\t0\\nThe acting was bad.  \\t0\\nReally bad.  \\t0\\nEven Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  \\t0\\nCamerawork - again, bad.  \\t0\\nRating: 1 out of 10.  \\t0\\nAn AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  \\t1\\nKieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  \\t1\\nHe is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  \\t1\\nHis use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  \\t1\\nThree of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  \\t1\\nAnd his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  \\t1\\nI have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  \\t1\\nI couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  \\t1\\nI recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  \\t1\\n10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  \\t1\\nI literally vomited while watching this film.  \\t0\\nI think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  \\t1\\nhis performance, as awarded, was stunning.  \\t1\\nthe story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  \\t1\\nIn a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  \\t1\\nAll in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  \\t1\\nI'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  \\t0\\nBut when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap.  \\t0\\nTo those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  \\t0\\nOne more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  \\t0\\nThis is such a fun and funny movie.  \\t1\\nHighly entertaining at all angles.  \\t1\\nIt features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  \\t1\\nSo for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  \\t1\\nIt even has its sweet moments.  \\t1\\nThe telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  \\t1\\nAll the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  \\t1\\nAnd I really did find them funny.  \\t1\\nThis is actually a very smart movie.  \\t1\\nThere is a brilliant twist ending.  \\t1\\n I love it.  \\t1\\nThe ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  \\t1\\nI am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  \\t1\\nI will never forget it now.  \\t1\\nIt is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  \\t1\\nWhich has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  \\t0\\nThe Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  \\t0\\nThis movie is terrible.  \\t0\\nThe hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  \\t0\\nFor those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  \\t0\\nTo call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  \\t0\\nStarted watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  \\t0\\nIn particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  \\t0\\nIt was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  \\t0\\nThe characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  \\t0\\nBy the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  \\t0\\nGlad I didn't pay to see it.  \\t0\\nDidn't laugh or even smile once.  \\t0\\nBut it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  \\t0\\nIt is a really good show to watch.  \\t1\\nIt is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  \\t1\\nBarney is definitely super DE duper.  \\t1\\nis pretty funny.  \\t1\\nBabie Bop is very cute.  \\t1\\nThe kids are very cool too.  \\t1\\n But Storm Trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  \\t0\\nIt's just lame.  \\t0\\nThe guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  \\t0\\nEverything about this movie is stupid.  \\t0\\nEven if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  \\t0\\nIt is shameful.  \\t0\\nI would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  \\t1\\nThe writers were smack on and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  \\t1\\nI must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  \\t1\\nNow you know why I gave it a 10+!  \\t1\\nI don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  \\t1\\nI totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  \\t1\\nThe things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  \\t1\\nThis is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  \\t1\\nMuch more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  \\t1\\nEverything from acting to cinematography was solid.  \\t1\\nDefinitely worth checking out.  \\t1\\nDamian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  \\t1\\nThis movie has a cutting edge to it.  \\t1\\nI am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  \\t1\\nThe new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  \\t0\\nI felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  \\t0\\nIt didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  \\t0\\nThe jerky camera movements were also annoying.  \\t0\\nThe plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  \\t0\\nThere was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  \\t0\\nI guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  \\t0\\nIf you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  \\t0\\nElias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  \\t1\\nThis was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  \\t1\\nI really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  \\t1\\nThis totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  \\t0\\nLucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  \\t0\\nAll this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  \\t0\\nGod, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  \\t0\\nI think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of wonder) are the excerpts from his works.  \\t1\\nThe sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  \\t1\\nThey could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  \\t1\\nThe stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  \\t1\\nAfter watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.  \\t1\\nI highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  \\t1\\nHere, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  \\t1\\n) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  \\t1\\nThough The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's Big Stick.  \\t1\\nThis is high adventure at its best.  \\t1\\nI think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  \\t1\\nHaving to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  \\t1\\n(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  \\t1\\nAlmost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  \\t0\\nThe most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  \\t0\\nUnfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  \\t0\\nNon-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  \\t1\\nThe good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  \\t1\\nA good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  \\t1\\nFor people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  \\t1\\nIt was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  \\t1\\nIt's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  \\t1\\nIt has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  \\t1\\nI rather enjoyed it.  \\t1\\nI liked it.  \\t1\\nI couldn't take them seriously.  \\t0\\nIt really created a unique feeling though.  \\t1\\nVivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  \\t1\\nA world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  \\t1\\nHer role was played well.  \\t1\\nNot too screamy not to masculine but just right.  \\t1\\nThe camera really likes her in this movie.  \\t1\\nI would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  \\t1\\nAs a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  \\t1\\nI am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  \\t0\\nEven worse than Ticker!  \\t0\\n& That movie was bad.  \\t0\\nOnly like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  \\t0\\nIt just blew.  \\t0\\nThis movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  \\t1\\nI just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughed,kids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes out,it has new features!  \\t1\\nNow we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  \\t0\\nThis show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere.  \\t0\\nAlmost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  \\t0\\nI wish I could enter negative values, admins?  \\t0\\nThe sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  \\t0\\nThe use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  \\t0\\nOh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  \\t0\\nI hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  \\t0\\nI am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  \\t0\\nIn short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  \\t0\\nIt came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  \\t0\\n1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  \\t0\\nAn interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  \\t1\\nThe soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  \\t1\\nBut the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  \\t0\\nStill, it was the SETS that got a big 10 on my oy-vey scale.  \\t1\\nYes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  \\t0\\nBoth do good jobs and are quite amusing.  \\t1\\nBut the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  \\t0\\nI let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  \\t0\\nThe last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  \\t1\\nBela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  \\t0\\nThe acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  \\t0\\nI like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  \\t1\\nI believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  \\t1\\nMy 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  \\t1\\nI won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  \\t1\\nWow, what a bad film.  \\t0\\nNot frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  \\t0\\nThe plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  \\t0\\nNot even good for camp value!  \\t0\\nI wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this?  \\t0\\nYou'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  \\t0\\nThis film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  \\t0\\nIf only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  \\t0\\nThis gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  \\t0\\nThis is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  \\t0\\nI know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  \\t0\\nVictor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  \\t0\\nConsidering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  \\t0\\nBut the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  \\t0\\nThe death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  \\t0\\nThe only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  \\t0\\nWhatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  \\t0\\nI was deeply impressed with the character he played.  \\t1\\nI knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  \\t1\\nA cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  \\t0\\nEven the squibs look awful.  \\t0\\nAt no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  \\t0\\nThe plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  \\t0\\nThe awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  \\t0\\nI was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  \\t0\\nThe dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  \\t0\\nAbout 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  \\t0\\nThe directing is sloppy at best.  \\t0\\nHackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  \\t0\\nOf course, the acting is blah.  \\t0\\nThe acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  \\t0\\nAnd, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  \\t0\\nI loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  \\t1\\nI have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  \\t1\\nThis movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  \\t1\\nThis movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  \\t1\\nOverall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  \\t1\\nLifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  \\t1\\nI particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  \\t0\\nIt is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  \\t0\\nTotally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  \\t1\\nThis movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  \\t1\\nBut this movie really got to me.  \\t1\\nSee it.  \\t1\\nI really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  \\t1\\nAnd I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa AurvÃ¥g being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  \\t1\\nThis movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  \\t1\\nI found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  \\t1\\nInitially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  \\t1\\nLater I found myself lost in the power of the film.  \\t1\\nThe entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  \\t1\\nI left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  \\t1\\nDuris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  \\t1\\nThe rest of the cast also play well.  \\t1\\nCinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  \\t1\\nAbout ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  \\t0\\nAbout half way through this film I started to dislike it.  \\t0\\nBy the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  \\t0\\nWhat this film lacks is a convincing script.  \\t0\\nThe script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  \\t0\\nThings happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  \\t0\\nThe cast is good.  \\t1\\nFor that, it's worth checking out.  \\t1\\nThis is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  \\t0\\nIt is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  \\t0\\nEverything about it is just bad.  \\t0\\nI could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  \\t0\\nThe script is bad, very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  \\t0\\nThe casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  \\t0\\nFinal Word: This Show is a real torture!!  \\t0\\nIt is zillion times away from reality.  \\t0\\nWatching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.  \\t0\\nRating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  \\t0\\n20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  \\t0\\nFull of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  \\t0\\nFrom here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  \\t0\\nHis losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  \\t0\\nAnd if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  \\t0\\nWhatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  \\t0\\n(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  \\t0\\nthere are so many problems i dont know where to start.  \\t0\\nthe cast was great.  \\t1\\nsteve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.  \\t1\\nadd betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  \\t1\\nbut the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  \\t0\\nfirst of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  \\t0\\nthe movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  \\t0\\nputting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.  \\t0\\nthere is no real plot.  \\t0\\ni wouldnt see this movie again for free.  \\t0\\nSTEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  \\t1\\nThis second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  \\t1\\nWhile you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  \\t1\\nHowever, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  \\t1\\nIt's just adorable seeing Mickey playing Turkey in the Straw in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  \\t1\\nClever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  \\t1\\nThe bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  \\t0\\nI'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  \\t0\\nThe original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  \\t1\\nJohn Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  \\t1\\nI don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  \\t0\\nThis may be the only bad film he ever made.  \\t0\\nSo bad...well...it's just bad.  \\t0\\nThis movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  \\t0\\nIt's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  \\t0\\nI thought it was bad.  \\t0\\nBoth films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  \\t0\\nLet's start with all the problemsÂ—the acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  \\t0\\nThe script is a big flawed mess.  \\t0\\nThe best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  \\t0\\nDirector Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie Grim, clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  \\t0\\nThe movie is terribly boring in places.  \\t0\\nThe lighting is awful.  \\t0\\nThe film looks cheap and bland.  \\t0\\nOne of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  \\t0\\nThis convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  \\t0\\nThe visual effects were AWFUL.  \\t0\\nThe CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  \\t0\\nThe explosion of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  \\t0\\nOkay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  \\t1\\nGotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  \\t1\\nTo sum the film up, Breeders is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  \\t0\\nNot recommended.  \\t0\\nHe is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  \\t0\\nAside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  \\t0\\nI understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  \\t0\\nLewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  \\t0\\nThe film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  \\t1\\nWith the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  \\t0\\nThe budget was evidently very limited.  \\t0\\nThis was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  \\t0\\nHowever, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  \\t0\\nFilmiing was less expansive.  \\t0\\nIt failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  \\t0\\nGenerally; it just lacked imagination.  \\t0\\nNot recommended.  \\t0\\nIs it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  \\t0\\nThere is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  \\t0\\nEven when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  \\t0\\nBeware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  \\t0\\nI can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  \\t0\\nWhich is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  \\t0\\nBeing a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  \\t1\\nBut Tiny Toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  \\t1\\nThe memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  \\t1\\nEasily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  \\t1\\nThe characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  \\t1\\nEvery single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  \\t1\\nEvery element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  \\t0\\nHer lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  \\t0\\nPerabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  \\t1\\nThere is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  \\t0\\nI saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  \\t0\\nWhat is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  \\t0\\nTo be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  \\t0\\nIn conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  \\t0\\nThe story line is just awful!  \\t0\\nIt's just painful!  \\t0\\nAnd the accents are absolutely abysmal!  \\t0\\nThere's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  \\t0\\nDon't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  \\t0\\nI believe that Pitch Black was done well.  \\t1\\nThe characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  \\t1\\nGo watch it!  \\t1\\nOmit watching this.  \\t0\\nVERY funny!  \\t1\\nMy rating: just 3 out of 10.  \\t0\\nThe characters are interesting and you really care for them.  \\t1\\nAn instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  \\t1\\nDon't miss it.  \\t1\\nThis is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  \\t1\\nA mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  \\t1\\nBut above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  \\t1\\nIt's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  \\t1\\nThe basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  \\t0\\nRegardless, the film fails on most levels.  \\t0\\nAvoid at all costs.  \\t0\\nI saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  \\t1\\nI thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  \\t1\\nHis acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  \\t1\\nI had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  \\t1\\nBut it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  \\t1\\nI'll give this film 10 out of 10!  \\t1\\nI know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  \\t0\\nHe really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  \\t0\\nLovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  \\t1\\nJimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  \\t1\\nNevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  \\t1\\nI have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  \\t1\\nExcellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  \\t1\\nBut it is entertaining, nonetheless.  \\t1\\nIt's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  \\t1\\nThere's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  \\t1\\nThe cast is always entertaining as usual.  \\t1\\nOverall, a delight!  \\t1\\nThis movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  \\t0\\nThe film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  \\t0\\nThe least said about the acting the better.  \\t0\\nThis movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  \\t1\\nI believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  \\t1\\nNothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  \\t1\\nThe acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  \\t1\\nDon't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  \\t1\\nExcellent performance.  \\t1\\nThere still are good actors around!  \\t1\\nAlso great directing and photography.  \\t1\\nVery true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  \\t1\\nMacbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  \\t1\\nHelen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  \\t1\\nIf you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  \\t1\\nThis is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  \\t1\\nSpecial mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  \\t1\\nHowever Paul Schrader has indeed made a film about Mishima that is both superb & complex.  \\t1\\nAlso notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  \\t1\\nEven allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  \\t0\\nUnless you're just out to visually collect all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.  \\t0\\nIf you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  \\t1\\nIt is not good.  \\t0\\nSpeaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  \\t0\\nThen the film just dropped the ball.  \\t0\\nThis is a stunning movie.  \\t1\\nRaw and sublimely moving.  \\t1\\nIt felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  \\t1\\nAll of the main players are mesmerising.  \\t1\\nTom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  \\t1\\nJulian Fellowes has triumphed again.  \\t1\\nHe's a national treasure.  \\t1\\nGO AND SEE IT!  \\t1\\nThis is an excellent film.  \\t1\\nThe aerial scenes were well-done.  \\t1\\nIt was also the right balance of war and love.  \\t1\\nThe film gives meaning to the phrase, Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  \\t1\\nKris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  \\t1\\nA good film by a great director!  \\t1\\nThis is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  \\t1\\nThere are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  \\t0\\nThis is just a great movie.  \\t1\\n10 out of 10 stars.  \\t1\\nI can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  \\t0\\nIt's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  \\t0\\nPunishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  \\t1\\nShot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.  \\t1\\nThis is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  \\t1\\nI advise you to look out for it.  \\t1\\nYou wont regret it!  \\t1\\nHighly recommended A+  \\t1\\nWell... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  \\t0\\nIt's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  \\t0\\nIt's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.  \\t0\\n) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  \\t0\\nIt is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  \\t0\\nHow awful she is!  \\t0\\nBut she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  \\t0\\nThe results, well, are a shame.  \\t0\\nDELETE this film from your mind!  \\t0\\nOne of the worst shows of all time.  \\t0\\nThe show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  \\t0\\nThe fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  \\t0\\nNever heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  \\t0\\nEvery time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, you see kids... Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  \\t0\\nThe stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  \\t0\\nLame would be the best way to describe it.  \\t0\\nStanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  \\t1\\nThe success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  \\t1\\nThe attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  \\t1\\nIm big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  \\t0\\nThe lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  \\t0\\nYou can find better movies at youtube.  \\t0\\nTop line: Don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.  \\t0\\nA Lassie movie which should have been put to sleep.... FOREVER.  \\t0\\nThat's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  \\t0\\nSo mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  \\t0\\nIt isn't even an achievement as a so-bad-it's-good or so-bad-it's-memorable movie.  \\t0\\nIt's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  \\t0\\nSeriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.  \\t0\\nAvoid, avoid, avoid!  \\t0\\nIt will drive you barking mad!  \\t0\\nThe transfers are very good.  \\t1\\nVery nice and relaxing late night viewing.  \\t1\\nThe movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  \\t1\\n) some great music, and terrific scenery.  \\t1\\nIt handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!  \\t1\\n) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!  \\t1\\nThe point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.  \\t1\\nIt's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  \\t1\\nNothing new there.  \\t0\\nThat was done in the second movie.  \\t0\\nThe movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  \\t0\\nThe plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  \\t0\\nWhat on earth is Irons doing in this film?  \\t0\\nI just saw this film and I recommend it.  \\t1\\nIt has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  \\t1\\nA very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  \\t1\\nTom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  \\t1\\nEmily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  \\t1\\nDespite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  \\t1\\nIn fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  \\t1\\nAailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  \\t1\\nI'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  \\t1\\nI guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  \\t1\\nThe football scenes at the end were perplexing.  \\t0\\nBut I thought his acting was skilled.  \\t1\\nMeredith M was better than all right.  \\t1\\nA very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  \\t1\\nIt is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  \\t1\\nNine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  \\t1\\nThis early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  \\t1\\nThis is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.  \\t1\\nA standout scene.  \\t1\\nThis scene is very strong and unpleasant.  \\t0\\nTechnically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  \\t1\\nIt's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  \\t1\\nThe movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  \\t1\\nI liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  \\t1\\nThis movie is also revealing.  \\t1\\nPersonally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  \\t1\\nAnd it was boring.  \\t0\\nI am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  \\t0\\nPS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  \\t1\\nIt's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  \\t1\\nAn Italian reviewer called this a small, great film, and that's right.  \\t1\\nAll the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  \\t1\\nYou learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  \\t1\\nThe movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating.  \\t1\\nAlso the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  \\t1\\nYou won't forget this movie!  \\t1\\nWhy was this film made?  \\t0\\nThe film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  \\t0\\nThe result is a film that just don't look right.  \\t0\\nNone of them are engaging or exciting.  \\t0\\nThe plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  \\t0\\nThe Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  \\t0\\nI saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was The Stranger and I loved it.  \\t1\\nBut the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  \\t1\\nThis movie is so awesome!  \\t1\\nI loved it, it was really scary.  \\t1\\nI love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  \\t1\\nIf you want a real scare rent this one!  \\t1\\n10/10  \\t1\\nThis is an extraordinary film.  \\t1\\nAs a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  \\t1\\nThis film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  \\t1\\nThe film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  \\t1\\nThis mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  \\t1\\nPredictable, but not a bad watch.  \\t1\\nIt was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  \\t1\\nShe carries the movie well.  \\t1\\nConstantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  \\t1\\nIt is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  \\t1\\nHow this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.  \\t0\\nIn fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  \\t0\\nAvoid at ALL costs!  \\t0\\nStar Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  \\t0\\nThe acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  \\t0\\nThe attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  \\t0\\nThe only place good for this film is in the garbage.  \\t0\\nThe worst one of the series.  \\t0\\nEditing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  \\t1\\nWhen a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  \\t1\\nCinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  \\t1\\nOf course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  \\t1\\nThis film offers many delights and surprises.  \\t1\\nWhen Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from Don Giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  \\t1\\nThe story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  \\t1\\nYou share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  \\t1\\nBut this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  \\t1\\nThe warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  \\t1\\nYou will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  \\t1\\nThe acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  \\t1\\nThe characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  \\t1\\nAngus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  \\t1\\nConclusion - I loved it.  \\t1\\nIt's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  \\t1\\nI struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  \\t1\\nMark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  \\t1\\nIt's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  \\t1\\nThe film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  \\t1\\nPlus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  \\t1\\nJuano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  \\t1\\nTrumbull on I LOVE LUCY).  \\t1\\nSee it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.  \\t1\\nSee both films if you can.  \\t1\\nIt was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella The Dead.  \\t1\\nFeelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  \\t1\\nVery disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  \\t0\\nIt's very slow.  \\t0\\nLot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  \\t0\\n) Don't waste your time.  \\t0\\nEnd of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  \\t0\\nHe surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  \\t0\\nThis was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  \\t0\\nI'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  \\t0\\nThis movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  \\t1\\nIt has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  \\t1\\n With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  \\t1\\nCall me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  \\t1\\nGreat character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  \\t1\\n1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  \\t0\\nLots of holes in the script.  \\t0\\nIt's like a bad two hour TV movie.  \\t0\\nNow imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  \\t0\\nThe dialogue is atrocious.  \\t0\\nThe acting is beyond abysmal.  \\t0\\nEverything stinks.  \\t0\\nTrouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  \\t0\\nWorse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  \\t0\\nIt's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  \\t0\\nIn short, don't bother with this movie.  \\t0\\nI won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  \\t1\\nThe best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  \\t1\\nIf there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  \\t1\\nThe result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  \\t1\\nA film not easily forgotten.  \\t1\\nBut, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor.  \\t1\\nThe scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  \\t1\\nThe characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  \\t1\\nHighly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  \\t1\\nGreat movie!  \\t1\\nAlso the story and acting were weak.  \\t0\\nAt around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  \\t0\\nEither way, it sucks.  \\t0\\nThe script is horrendously stupid.  \\t0\\nThe story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  \\t0\\nEverything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  \\t0\\nWhat the hell kind of crap is that?!  \\t0\\nThen, there's the plot holes.  \\t0\\nYou could drive a semi truck into these holes!  \\t0\\nLinda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  \\t1\\nShe's poised and amazing.  \\t1\\nDee Snider just plain sucks.  \\t0\\nHe can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  \\t0\\nI was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  \\t0\\nThe acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  \\t0\\nThis film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  \\t0\\nThis is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  \\t0\\nA piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  \\t0\\nAvoid at any and all costs.  \\t0\\nAt any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  \\t0\\nAvoid this film at all costs.  \\t0\\nI don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  \\t0\\nThe only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  \\t0\\nNow this is a movie I really dislike.  \\t0\\nIt's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  \\t0\\nThe puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  \\t0\\nThe story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  \\t0\\nThere aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  \\t0\\nI felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  \\t0\\nThe fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  \\t1\\nThe best part about Nurse Betty is it's unpredictability.  \\t1\\nDirector Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  \\t1\\nOtherwise, don't even waste your time on this.  \\t0\\nThis one just fails to create any real suspense.  \\t0\\nAs for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  \\t0\\nThere is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  \\t1\\nI'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  \\t0\\nOne of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  \\t0\\nThe secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  \\t0\\nHated it.  \\t0\\nThis is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  \\t0\\nI don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  \\t0\\nI highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  \\t0\\nThis is not movie-making.  \\t0\\nThe acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  \\t0\\nSo I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  \\t0\\nI saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  \\t1\\nI didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  \\t1\\nExcellent short film.  \\t1\\nHopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  \\t1\\nI agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  \\t0\\nCharacters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  \\t0\\nThe story line is totally predictable.  \\t0\\nNot much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  \\t1\\nI've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  \\t0\\nBad characters, bad story and bad acting.  \\t0\\nReally awful.  \\t0\\nNot easy to watch.  \\t0\\nFunny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!  \\t1\\nIt was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  \\t1\\nPaolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  \\t1\\nThe movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  \\t1\\nI rate this movie 9/10.  \\t1\\nI do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  \\t1\\nThe interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  \\t1\\nKathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in At Play In The Fields Of The Lord.  \\t1\\nFor readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  \\t1\\nIt never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  \\t1\\nThe two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  \\t1\\nThey are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  \\t1\\nThis movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  \\t1\\nThe scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  \\t1\\nThe story is also both funny and poignant at times.  \\t1\\nPeople who like European films and art movies will like this movie.  \\t1\\nThis is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  \\t1\\nGo rent it.  \\t1\\nHowever, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  \\t1\\nIt's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  \\t1\\nBrilliance indeed.  \\t1\\nBut if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  \\t1\\nThink of the film being like a dream.  \\t1\\nSimply beautiful.  \\t1\\nBoth Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  \\t1\\nIt's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  \\t1\\nIt presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  \\t1\\nJust whatever you do, avoid Groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  \\t0\\nIt's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  \\t0\\nThe movie seemed a little slow at first.  \\t0\\nBut it picked up speed and got right to the point.  \\t1\\nIt showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget.  \\t1\\nI enjoyed it.  \\t1\\nI have recommended it to friends.  \\t1\\nI was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  \\t1\\nBoth actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  \\t1\\nTheir on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  \\t1\\nThe film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  \\t1\\nThe writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  \\t1\\nThe incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  \\t1\\nEach track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  \\t1\\nDefinitely worth seeingÂ… it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  \\t1\\nHayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, Gake No Ue No Ponyo (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  \\t1\\nAt a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  \\t1\\nEnough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  \\t1\\nThe art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  \\t1\\nIf you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  \\t0\\nThis one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  \\t0\\nIf you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  \\t0\\nStill, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  \\t1\\nJust consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  \\t1\\nInstead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  \\t0\\nThen I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  \\t1\\nIt is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  \\t1\\nJudith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  \\t1\\nI keep watching it over and over.  \\t1\\nIt's a sad movie, but very good.  \\t1\\nIf you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  \\t1\\nShe is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  \\t1\\nStill it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  \\t1\\n;) Recommend with confidence!  \\t1\\nThis movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  \\t1\\nIt was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  \\t1\\n:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  \\t1\\nThe opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  \\t1\\nFans of the genre will be in heaven.  \\t1\\nLange had become a great actress.  \\t1\\nIt looked like a wonderful story.  \\t1\\nI never walked out of a movie faster.  \\t0\\nI just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  \\t0\\nUnfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  \\t0\\nIn a word, it is embarrassing.  \\t0\\nExceptionally bad!  \\t0\\nAll in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  \\t0\\n\""

If I could give this zero stars I would.\\t0\\nTrying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.\\t0\\nThe case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.\\t0\\nI own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.\\t1\\nI love the camera, it\\'s really pretty good quality.\\t1\\nThank you for such great service.\\t1\\nIts a total package.\\t1\\nThe seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.\\t1\\nI give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.\\t0\\nIt\\'s AGGRAVATING!\\t0\\nGreat product for the price!.\\t1\\nI have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use\\t1\\nVirgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!\\t1\\nNone of it works, just don\\'t buy it.\\t0\\nMuddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire\\'s insert was poorly super glued and slid off.\\t0\\nPlease dont waste your money.\\t0\\nAll in all, I\\'m quite satisfied with this purchase.\\t1\\nIf you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn\\'t it.\\t0\\nYet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.\\t0\\nDisapointing Results.\\t0\\nCumbersome design.\\t0\\nGreat it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!\\t1\\nGreat Product.\\t1\\nIt\\'s A PIECE OF CRAP!\\t0\\nMy experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!\\t0\\nThis fixes all the problems.\\t1\\nWorst ever.\\t0\\nI am very happy\\t1\\nI\\'ve had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.\\t1\\nI can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying \"what?\"\\t0\\nThe battery life is highly unacceptable.\\t0\\nThat company is a joke.\\t0\\nIt does everything the description said it would.\\t1\\nDue to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.\\t0\\nIt works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.\\t1\\nVerizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.\\t0\\nVoice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.\\t0\\nIt plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it\\'s not.\\t1\\nBetter than expected.\\t1\\nIt feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.\\t0\\nBattery is holding up well.\\t1\\nAlso difficult to put on.I\\'d recommend avoiding this product.\\t0\\nI only used it two days, and it wasn\\'t always easy to hear with.\\t0\\nI got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.\\t0\\nSprint - terrible customer service.\\t0\\nLinked to my phone without effort.\\t1\\nTHey are so cool!\\t1\\nEasy to use.\\t1\\nBetter Than New.\\t1\\nWhat possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...\\t0\\nPiece of trash.\\t0\\nA pretty good product.\\t1\\nThis is a great phone!.\\t1\\nFor the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.\\t1\\nTheir Research and Development division obviously knows what they\\'re doing.\\t1\\nThe real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.\\t0\\nThose phones are working just fine now.\\t1\\nI am more than happy with this product.\\t1\\nPoor Construction.\\t0\\nThis is infuriating.\\t0\\nOverall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.\\t1\\nSprint charges for this service.\\t0\\nIt is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.\\t0\\nIt fits my ear well and is comfortable on.\\t1\\nIt doesn\\'t work in Europe or Asia.\\t0\\nclipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent\\'s up-and-coming.\\t1\\nI like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.\\t1\\nI was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.\\t1\\nthe worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.\\t0\\nthe charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.\\t0\\nPoor product.\\t0\\nHowever I needed some better instructions.\\t0\\nYou need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.\\t0\\nWorked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).\\t1\\nSteer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.\\t0\\nDO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS\\t0\\nThis is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.\\t1\\nPlus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.\\t0\\nAll the other cases I\\'ve tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.\\t1\\nVery Dissapointing Performance.\\t0\\nDon\\'t make the same mistake that I did and please don\\'t buy this phone.\\t0\\nThis phone might well be the worst I\\'ve ever had in any brand.\\t0\\nCase was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.\\t0\\nI recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.\\t1\\nDon\\'t bother - go to the store.\\t0\\nI posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it\\'s a great color!\\t1\\nI did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.\\t1\\nYou get what you pay for I guess.\\t0\\nNot only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.\\t1\\nim surprised this is a good quality car charger and there\\'s not much reviews about it.\\t1\\nThese are fabulous!\\t1\\nHowever, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.\\t0\\nI used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.\\t1\\nDisappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.\\t0\\nPerformed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.\\t0\\nVery wind-resistant.\\t1\\nObviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.\\t0\\nThey do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.\\t1\\nI contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn\\'t produce my receipt I was out of luck.\\t0\\nLinksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!\\t0\\nPhone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.\\t1\\nGreat phone.\\t1\\nWhen I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.\\t0\\nI\\'m pleased.\\t1\\nBattery is terrible.\\t0\\nI found the product to be easy to set up and use.\\t1\\nThe earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.\\t0\\nUtter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.\\t0\\nThe charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.\\t0\\nNo ear loop needed, it\\'s tiny and the sound is great.\\t1\\nFinally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.\\t0\\nThe handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.\\t1\\nTalk about USELESS customer service.\\t0\\nIt felt too light and \"tinny.\".\\t0\\nThis does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.\\t0\\nI\\'m happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.\\t1\\nI love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.\\t1\\nIts well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.\\t1\\nDoes everything it should and more.\\t1\\nI could not recommend these more.\\t0\\nNice Sound.\\t1\\nLooks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!\\t0\\nMuch less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.\\t1\\nSetup went very smoothly.\\t1\\nits extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.\\t0\\nA must study for anyone interested in the \"worst sins\" of industrial design.\\t0\\nThe first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.\\t0\\nIt is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.\\t1\\nThen I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.\\t0\\nCan\\'t upload ringtones from a third party.\\t0\\nBluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.\\t0\\nTruly awful.\\t0\\nIt works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.\\t1\\nThe volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).\\t1\\nAnd none of the tones is acceptable.\\t0\\ncamera color balance is AWFUL.\\t0\\nThis product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don\\'t care how cool it looks, if you can\\'t tell a call is coming in it\\'s worthless.\\t0\\nI love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!\\t1\\nChinese Forgeries Abound!.\\t0\\nEasy to pair with my Samsung Cell.\\t1\\nThe instructions didn\\'t explain that a microphone jack could be used.\\t0\\ni would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.\\t0\\nToo bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!\\t0\\nWorks well.\\t1\\nThe nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.\\t0\\nClear crisp sound.\\t1\\nI have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.\\t1\\nThe biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.\\t0\\nThe design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.\\t0\\nDo NOT buy if you want to use the holster.\\t0\\nThe phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.\\t1\\nIt doesn\\'t make you look cool.\\t0\\nBecause both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.\\t1\\nComfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.\\t1\\nAlso, the phone doesn\\'t seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.\\t0\\nYou can\\'t beat the price on these.\\t1\\n* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!\\t1\\nlightweight and works well.\\t1\\nSo just beware.\\t0\\nI love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.\\t1\\nSo anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.\\t0\\nThis is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.\\t1\\nI bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.\\t0\\nAppears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.\\t1\\nCan\\'t store anything but phone numbers to SIM.\\t0\\nIt lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.\\t0\\nPoor quality.\\t0\\njabra ear gels \"R\" the best!.\\t1\\nNot worth it.\\t0\\nThe phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.\\t0\\nIt quit working after I\\'d used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I\\'ve ever owned.\\t1\\nUnfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).\\t0\\nIt was a great phone.\\t1\\nif you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.\\t0\\nGood value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.\\t1\\nMy phone doesn\\'t slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.\\t1\\nThis is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!\\t1\\nThink it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!\\t0\\nIn the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim \"Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?\\t1\\nI have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.\\t1\\nThis case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.\\t1\\nOther than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.\\t1\\nIt has everything I need and I couldn\\'t ask for more.\\t1\\nAfter receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.\\t0\\nThis product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.\\t1\\nNone of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.\\t0\\nT-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.\\t1\\nArrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.\\t1\\nWe have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros\\t0\\nProvides good protection and looks classy, too.\\t1\\nKrussel Always good.\\t1\\nThe tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc.\\t1\\nThe design is very good.4.\\t1\\nI great reception all the time.\\t1\\nI would highly recommend this product.\\t1\\nCouldn\\'t use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!\\t0\\nIt dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.\\t0\\nBought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.\\t0\\nIf you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!\\t0\\nFantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is\\t1\\nstay away from this store, be careful.\\t0\\nThis BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.\\t1\\nDoes not fit.\\t0\\n.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.\\t1\\nIt is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.\\t1\\ndisappointing.\\t0\\nBlue Ant is easy to use.\\t1\\nCheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.\\t1\\nThe camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I\\'d rather be using a disposable then this.\\t0\\nThen a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.\\t0\\nIt\\'s very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.\\t1\\nThe nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.\\t0\\nThe sound quality is excellent as well.\\t1\\nIts the best headset I have used.\\t1\\nWould not reccommend.\\t0\\nThey have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.\\t1\\nJust what I wanted.\\t1\\nThis particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.\\t0\\nwont work right or atleast for me.\\t0\\nin addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.\\t0\\nBut now that it is \"out of warranty\" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.\\t0\\nI really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good\\t0\\nGreat product.\\t1\\nCrisp and Clear.\\t1\\nAFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.\\t0\\nVERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor.\\t0\\nI get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.\\t0\\nThe reception has been generally good.\\t1\\nExcellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.\\t1\\nGreat bluetooth!.\\t1\\nI highly recommend this case.\\t1\\nWORTHWHILE.\\t1\\nThis is a great deal.\\t1\\nAfter my phone got to be about a year old, it\\'s been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.\\t0\\nI am sorry I made this purchase.\\t0\\nI bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.\\t0\\nTreo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.\\t0\\nIt was horrible!.\\t0\\nI don\\'t think it would hold it too securly on your belt.\\t0\\nThis allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.\\t0\\nThey work about 2 weeks then break.\\t0\\nIt is simple to use and I like it.\\t1\\nIt\\'s a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!\\t1\\nI can\\'t use this case because the smell is disgusting.\\t0\\nNOT WHAT I WANTED.\\t0\\nI own 2 of these cases and would order another.\\t1\\nGreat Phone.\\t1\\nI bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I\\'m very happy with my purchase.\\t1\\nThe internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.\\t0\\nPerfect for the PS3.\\t1\\nFive star Plus, plus.\\t1\\nA good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn\\'t hear me.\\t1\\n$50 Down the drain.\\t0\\nI tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn\\'t great.\\t0\\nGood , works fine.\\t1\\nFor the price this was a great deal.\\t1\\nGreat price, too!\\t1\\nIf there is a wind, it is completely useless.\\t0\\nYes it\\'s shiny on front side - and I love it!\\t1\\nDoes Not Work.\\t0\\nAt first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).\\t0\\nThe reception through this headset is excellent.\\t1\\n2 thumbs up to this seller\\t1\\nI have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.\\t1\\nImproper description.... I had to return it.\\t0\\n#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.\\t1\\nBattery charge-life is quite long.\\t1\\nThe Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.\\t1\\nBattery has no life.\\t0\\nI checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.\\t0\\nProduct is exactly as described.\\t1\\nGets a signal when other Verizon phones won\\'t.\\t1\\nDoesn\\'t do the job.\\t0\\nI would recommend it.\\t1\\nPlan on ordering from them again and again.\\t1\\nThat being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.\\t1\\nI have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.\\t1\\nThey keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I\\'ve had numerous Palms too).\\t1\\nAwkward to use and unreliable.\\t0\\nThe shipping time was also very quick!\\t1\\nNot as good as I had hoped.\\t0\\nGood case!.\\t1\\nDoesn\\'t Work.\\t0\\nReally good product.\\t1\\nUnfortunately it did not work.\\t0\\nAll three broke within two months of use.\\t0\\ndont buy it.\\t0\\nMy father has the V265, and the battery is dying.\\t0\\nHowever, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.\\t0\\nThe calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.\\t0\\nHorrible, horrible protector.\\t0\\nI don\\'t like this Nokia either.\\t0\\nReaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.\\t0\\nI have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.\\t0\\nIt would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.\\t0\\nthe only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!\\t0\\nTerrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.\\t0\\nProduct is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.\\t0\\nIt\\'s not what it says it is.\\t0\\nStay Away From the Q!.\\t0\\nUsed and dirty.\\t0\\nVery unreliable service from T-mobile !\\t0\\nNot good enough for the price.\\t0\\nI bought two of them and neither will charge.\\t0\\nIt looks very nice.\\t1\\nThis is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone\\'s auto-answer.\\t1\\nI have read other\\'s reviews here but I haven\\'t had any problem with it.\\t1\\nThese products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.\\t0\\nComfortable in my hand.\\t1\\nJust does not work.\\t0\\nPoor Reliability.\\t0\\n(It works!)\\t1\\nIf I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.\\t0\\nTerrible product, and waste of money!\\t0\\nLast time buying from you.\\t0\\nIt was a waste of my money.\\t0\\nSo far it has worked like a charm.\\t1\\nI have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.\\t1\\nBut, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.\\t1\\nWould recommend this item.\\t1\\nIt\\'s been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.\\t1\\nNice case, feels good in your hands.\\t1\\nThe item received was Counterfeit.\\t0\\nJust really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had.\\t1\\nWorks fine.\\t1\\nI received my headset in good time and was happy with it.\\t1\\nI was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.\\t1\\nMy sister has one also and she loves it.\\t1\\nGood Quality.\\t1\\nThis is by far the worst purchase I\\'ve made on Amazon.\\t0\\nExcellent dual-purpose headset.\\t1\\nExcellent!.\\t1\\nDoes not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.\\t0\\nIt seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.\\t1\\nThe bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.\\t0\\nHaving trouble with volume.\\t0\\nThe only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.\\t1\\nWARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.\\t0\\nI am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far.\\t1\\nWhen it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.\\t0\\nI didn\\'t want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.\\t0\\nBest headset ever!!!.\\t1\\nDon\\'t trust their website and don\\'t expect any helpful support.\\t0\\nIt was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.\\t1\\nThe speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.\\t0\\nFits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.\\t1\\nExcellent product for the price.\\t1\\nBad Reception.\\t0\\nThis product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!\\t0\\nIt was quite comfortable in the ear.\\t1\\nGreat phone.\\t1\\nDon\\'t buy this product - It fails!.\\t0\\nEverything about this product is wrong.First\\t0\\nThe pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.\\t1\\nThis was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.\\t0\\nTerrible phone holder.\\t0\\nThe cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.\\t1\\nI love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.\\t1\\nProblem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.\\t0\\nNot nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.\\t0\\nBut despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.\\t1\\nHow stupid is that?\\t0\\nI can hear while I\\'m driving in the car, and usually don\\'t even have to put it on it\\'s loudest setting.\\t1\\nSeller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.\\t1\\nGood show, Samsung.\\t1\\nSo I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.\\t1\\nIt always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.\\t0\\nCouldn\\'t figure it out\\t0\\nMy phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife\\'s phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn\\'t understand a word being said on it.\\t0\\nSo I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.\\t0\\nWhile I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.\\t0\\nLeopard Print is wonderfully wild!.\\t1\\nWorks for me.\\t1\\nSaggy, floppy piece of junk.\\t0\\nmuch better than the hard plastic cases.\\t1\\nIt also had a new problem.\\t0\\nHappy so far!.\\t1\\ncool phone.\\t1\\nWorks good.\\t1\\nMotorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.\\t1\\nIt looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.\\t0\\nbut it is great, i would really recommend it\\t1\\nMakes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I\\'m not wearing it.\\t0\\nAs I said above....PRETTY USELESS!\\t0\\nNever got it!!!!!\\t0\\nThis pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.\\t0\\n[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!\\t0\\nDoes not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.\\t0\\nYou get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off.\"\\t1\\nHowever, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn\\'t receive and place calls.\\t0\\nI kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.\\t0\\nThe headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.\\t1\\nLogitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.\\t1\\nI like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.\\t1\\nA lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.\\t1\\nI have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.\\t1\\nThe mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.\\t0\\nI\\'m returning them.\\t0\\nI does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.\\t0\\nIt is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.\\t1\\nI have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.\\t1\\nOtherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.\\t1\\nnice leather.\\t1\\nI had to purchase a different case.\\t0\\nIt is a joy to use.\\t1\\nVery much disappointed with this company.\\t0\\nVery satisifed with that.\\t1\\nIt didn\\'t charge for me.\\t0\\nThis is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!\\t1\\nButtons are too small.\\t0\\nJust reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.\\t1\\nLove it.. Great armband.\\t1\\nI really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.\\t1\\nHowever, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.\\t0\\nI exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I\\'m pretty happy with that decision.\\t1\\nI was very impressed with the price of the cases.\\t1\\nAlso makes it easier to hold on to.\\t1\\nI use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!\\t1\\nIt\\'s pretty easy.\\t1\\nI cannot make calls at certain places.\\t0\\nhowever, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn\\'t wake up like normal phone does.\\t0\\nBeautiful styling though.\\t1\\nThis company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.\\t0\\nI\\'m trying to return it for a refund.\\t0\\nI plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.\\t0\\nExcellent product.\\t1\\nEarbud piece breaks easily.\\t0\\nLousy product.\\t0\\nThis phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it\\'s very ability to be a phone.\\t0\\nIt is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.\\t1\\nSWEETEST PHONE!!!\\t1\\n:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.\\t1\\nIt fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.\\t1\\nNot enough volume.\\t0\\nEcho Problem....Very unsatisfactory\\t0\\nyou could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.\\t0\\ndon\\'t waste your money.\\t0\\nI am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.\\t0\\nAdapter does not provide enough charging current.\\t0\\nThere was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.\\t0\\nYou also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.\\t0\\nPhone falls out easily.\\t0\\nIt didn\\'t work, people can not hear me when I talk.\\t0\\nThe text messaging feature is really tricky to use.\\t0\\nI\\'m really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn\\'t work.\\t0\\nPainful on the ear.\\t0\\nLasted one day and then blew up.\\t0\\ndisappointed.\\t0\\nKind of flops around.\\t0\\nThe screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.\\t0\\nWhat a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.\\t0\\nItem Does Not Match Picture.\\t0\\nThe only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).\\t0\\nYou can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!\\t0\\n'"

Loved this place.\\t1\\nCrust is not good.\\t0\\nNot tasty and the texture was just nasty.\\t0\\nStopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.\\t1\\nThe selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.\\t1\\nNow I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.\\t0\\nHoneslty it didn\\'t taste THAT fresh.)\\t0\\nThe potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.\\t0\\nThe fries were great too.\\t1\\nA great touch.\\t1\\nService was very prompt.\\t1\\nWould not go back.\\t0\\nThe cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.\\t0\\nI tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!\\t1\\nI was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.\\t0\\nI was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.\\t0\\nHighly recommended.\\t1\\nWaitress was a little slow in service.\\t0\\nThis place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.\\t0\\ndid not like at all.\\t0\\nThe Burrittos Blah!\\t0\\nThe food, amazing.\\t1\\nService is also cute.\\t1\\nI could care less... The interior is just beautiful.\\t1\\nSo they performed.\\t1\\nThat\\'s right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.\\t1\\n- They never brought a salad we asked for.\\t0\\nThis hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.\\t1\\nTook an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.\\t0\\nThe worst was the salmon sashimi.\\t0\\nAlso there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.\\t1\\nThis was like the final blow!\\t0\\nI found this place by accident and I could not be happier.\\t1\\nseems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.\\t0\\nOverall, I like this place a lot.\\t1\\nThe only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.\\t1\\nAmple portions and good prices.\\t1\\nPoor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.\\t0\\nMy first visit to Hiro was a delight!\\t1\\nService sucks.\\t0\\nThe shrimp tender and moist.\\t1\\nThere is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.\\t0\\nHard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn\\'t want to eat it for fear of getting sick.\\t0\\nOn a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.\\t1\\nFrozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.\\t0\\nThe only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.\\t1\\nIt\\'s too bad the food is so damn generic.\\t0\\nThe burger is good beef, cooked just right.\\t1\\nIf you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!\\t1\\nMy side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.\\t1\\nWe ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.\\t1\\nHe came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.\\t1\\nTheir chow mein is so good!\\t1\\nThey have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don\\'t enjoy their food.\\t0\\nThe portion was huge!\\t1\\nLoved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.\\t1\\nThe Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.\\t0\\nNot much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.\\t0\\nThe salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.\\t1\\nThe ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.\\t0\\nAt least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.\\t0\\nThis place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!\\t1\\nThe cocktails are all handmade and delicious.\\t1\\nWe\\'d definitely go back here again.\\t1\\nWe are so glad we found this place.\\t1\\nGreat food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.\\t1\\nAlways a great time at Dos Gringos!\\t1\\nUpdate.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing\\t1\\nWe got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.\\t0\\nA great way to finish a great.\\t1\\nThe deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.\\t1\\n- Really, really good rice, all the time.\\t1\\nThe service was meh.\\t0\\nIt took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.\\t0\\nI guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn\\'t use my common sense.\\t0\\nThe scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.\\t0\\n2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !\\t0\\nThe sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.\\t1\\nToday is the second time I\\'ve been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.\\t1\\nThere is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.\\t0\\nComing here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can\\'t wait for the other person to ask to break up.\\t0\\nwalked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.\\t0\\nThe turkey and roast beef were bland.\\t0\\nThis place has it!\\t1\\nThe pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.\\t0\\nI love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.\\t1\\nThe poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.\\t0\\nAll I have to say is the food was amazing!!!\\t1\\nOmelets are to die for!\\t1\\nEverything was fresh and delicious!\\t1\\nIn summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.\\t0\\nIt\\'s like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you\\'re outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.\\t1\\nNever been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!\\t0\\nBest breakfast buffet!!!\\t1\\nsay bye bye to your tip lady!\\t0\\nWe\\'ll never go again.\\t0\\nWill be back again!\\t1\\nFood arrived quickly!\\t1\\nIt was not good.\\t0\\nOn the up side, their cafe serves really good food.\\t1\\nOur server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!\\t1\\nThe only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary\\'s coming.\\t1\\nBest Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.\\t1\\nI LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.\\t1\\nThis is one of the better buffets that I have been to.\\t1\\nSo we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!\\t1\\nThe food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!\\t1\\nThe ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.\\t1\\nWill go back next trip out.\\t1\\nSooooo good!!\\t1\\nREAL sushi lovers, let\\'s be honest - Yama is not that good.\\t0\\nAt least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn\\'t that busy.\\t0\\nThis is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.\\t1\\nNice, spicy and tender.\\t1\\nGood prices.\\t1\\nCheck it out.\\t1\\nIt was pretty gross!\\t0\\nI\\'ve had better atmosphere.\\t0\\nKind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.\\t0\\nAlthough I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.\\t0\\nI just don\\'t know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.\\t0\\nWorst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.\\t0\\nService was fine and the waitress was friendly.\\t1\\nThe guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he\\'s ever eaten.\\t1\\nWe thought you\\'d have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.\\t1\\nHost staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!\\t0\\nBland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don\\'t want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I\\'ll leave it at that...\\t0\\nPhenomenal food, service and ambiance.\\t1\\nI wouldn\\'t return.\\t0\\nDefinitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I\\'m in Vegas.\\t1\\nThis place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.\\t0\\nPenne vodka excellent!\\t1\\nThey have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.\\t1\\nThe management is rude.\\t0\\nDelicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.\\t1\\nGreat Subway, in fact it\\'s so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.\\t1\\nI had a seriously solid breakfast here.\\t1\\nThis is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.\\t1\\nHe was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.\\t0\\nMy drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.\\t1\\nDon\\'t do it!!!!\\t0\\nThe waiter wasn\\'t helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.\\t0\\nMy husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.\\t0\\nAnd the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn\\'t very tasty to me.\\t0\\nNice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.\\t1\\nThe bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.\\t1\\nThe menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.\\t0\\nThe service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.\\t0\\nI give it 2 thumbs down\\t0\\nWe watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.\\t0\\nMy fiancÃ© and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.\\t1\\nThis is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.\\t1\\nWe waited for forty five minutes in vain.\\t0\\nCrostini that came with the salad was stale.\\t0\\nSome highlights : Great quality nigiri here!\\t1\\nthe staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.\\t1\\nthis was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.\\t1\\nI ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I\\'d had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.\\t1\\nthis place is good.\\t1\\nUnfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.\\t0\\nI came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.\\t0\\nI was seated immediately.\\t1\\nTheir menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.\\t1\\nAvoid at all cost!\\t0\\nRestaurant is always full but never a wait.\\t1\\nDELICIOUS!!\\t1\\nThis place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.\\t1\\nSo don\\'t go there if you are looking for good food...\\t0\\nI\\'ve never been treated so bad.\\t0\\nBacon is hella salty.\\t1\\nWe also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.\\t0\\nThis really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.\\t1\\nThe waitresses are very friendly.\\t1\\nLordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!\\t1\\nEverything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.\\t1\\nPerhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I\\'m not inspired to go back.\\t0\\nThe service here leaves a lot to be desired.\\t0\\nThe atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.\\t1\\nNot a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.\\t1\\nWe literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.\\t0\\nThe burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.\\t0\\nI also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.\\t0\\nI dressed up to be treated so rudely!\\t0\\nIt was probably dirt.\\t0\\nLove this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.\\t1\\nI ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.\\t1\\nThe food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.\\t0\\nInteresting decor.\\t1\\nWhat I really like there is the crepe station.\\t1\\nAlso were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.\\t1\\nyou can watch them preparing the delicious food!)\\t1\\nBoth of the egg rolls were fantastic.\\t1\\nWhen my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.\\t0\\nI had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.\\t1\\nI\\'m not really sure how Joey\\'s was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.\\t0\\nThe best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!\\t1\\nThe live music on Fridays totally blows.\\t0\\nI\\'ve never been more insulted or felt disrespected.\\t0\\nVery friendly staff.\\t1\\nIt is worth the drive.\\t1\\nI had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.\\t1\\nFood was great and so was the serivce!\\t1\\nThe warm beer didn\\'t help.\\t0\\nGreat brunch spot.\\t1\\nService is friendly and inviting.\\t1\\nVery good lunch spot.\\t1\\nI\\'ve lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I\\'ve stepped foot into this place.\\t0\\nThe WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.\\t0\\nMust have been an off night at this place.\\t0\\nThe sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.\\t1\\nIf that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.\\t0\\nFor about 10 minutes, we we\\'re waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn\\'t coming any time soon.\\t0\\nMy friend loved the salmon tartar.\\t1\\nWon\\'t go back.\\t0\\nExtremely Tasty!\\t1\\nWaitress was good though!\\t1\\nSoggy and not good.\\t0\\nThe Jamaican mojitos are delicious.\\t1\\nWhich are small and not worth the price.\\t0\\n- the food is rich so order accordingly.\\t1\\nThe shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don\\'t mind being nude for everyone to see!\\t0\\nThe service was a bit lacking.\\t0\\nLobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.\\t0\\nHopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.\\t0\\nIt was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.\\t0\\nI loved the bacon wrapped dates.\\t1\\nThis is an unbelievable BARGAIN!\\t1\\nThe folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.\\t1\\nAs for the \"mains,\" also uninspired.\\t0\\nThis is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!\\t1\\nThis wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.\\t1\\nIf the food isn\\'t bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world\\'s worst/annoying drunk people.\\t0\\nVery very fun chef.\\t1\\nOrdered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.\\t0\\nGreat place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV\\'s.\\t1\\nIf it were possible to give them zero stars, they\\'d have it.\\t0\\nThe descriptions said \"yum yum sauce\" and another said \"eel sauce\", yet another said \"spicy mayo\"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.\\t0\\nI\\'d say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M\\'s dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).\\t1\\nIf she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.\\t0\\nEveryone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.\\t1\\nHorrible - don\\'t waste your time and money.\\t0\\nNow this dish was quite flavourful.\\t1\\nBy this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.\\t0\\n(It wasn\\'t busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.\\t0\\nlike the other reviewer said \"you couldn\\'t pay me to eat at this place again.\"\\t0\\n-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.\\t0\\nSeriously flavorful delights, folks.\\t1\\nMuch better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.\\t1\\nThe lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.\\t1\\nBased on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won\\'t be going back.\\t0\\nOwner\\'s are really great people.!\\t1\\nThere is nothing privileged about working/eating there.\\t0\\nThe Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.\\t1\\nOverall, I don\\'t think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.\\t0\\nNow the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.\\t1\\nWe had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.\\t1\\nFantastic service here.\\t1\\nI as well would\\'ve given godfathers zero stars if possible.\\t0\\nThey know how to make them here.\\t1\\nvery tough and very short on flavor!\\t0\\nI hope this place sticks around.\\t1\\nI have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.\\t0\\nThe restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.\\t1\\nGood service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!\\t1\\nThe seafood was fresh and generous in portion.\\t1\\nPlus, it\\'s only 8 bucks.\\t1\\nThe service was not up to par, either.\\t0\\nThus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.\\t1\\nJust as good as when I had it more than a year ago!\\t1\\nFor a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.\\t0\\nThe Veggitarian platter is out of this world!\\t1\\nYou cant go wrong with any of the food here.\\t1\\nYou can\\'t beat that.\\t1\\nStopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.\\t1\\nThe chefs were friendly and did a good job.\\t1\\nI\\'ve had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.\\t0\\nI liked the patio and the service was outstanding.\\t1\\nThe goat taco didn\\'t skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!\\t1\\nI think not again\\t0\\nI had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.\\t0\\nI went to Bachi Burger on a friend\\'s recommendation and was not disappointed.\\t1\\nService stinks here!\\t0\\nI waited and waited.\\t0\\nThis place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.\\t0\\nI would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.\\t1\\nGreat Pizza and Salads!\\t1\\nThings that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.\\t0\\nWe waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.\\t0\\nThis place is amazing!\\t1\\nI hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.\\t0\\nWaited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!\\t0\\nJust don\\'t know why they were so slow.\\t0\\nThe staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.\\t1\\nI live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won\\'t be back here, because it is a convenient location.\\t0\\nI didn\\'t know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.\\t1\\nYou get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.\\t1\\nBefore I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.\\t0\\nI love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.\\t1\\nNever again will I be dining at this place!\\t0\\nThe food was excellent and service was very good.\\t1\\nGood beer & drink selection and good food selection.\\t1\\nPlease stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.\\t0\\nThe potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.\\t0\\nFood was really boring.\\t0\\nGood Service-check!\\t1\\nThis greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!\\t0\\nWill never, ever go back.\\t0\\nAs much as I\\'d like to go back, I can\\'t get passed the atrocious service and will never return.\\t0\\nIn the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.\\t1\\nI did not expect this to be so good!\\t1\\nFantastic food!\\t1\\nShe ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.\\t0\\nThe food was very good.\\t1\\nNever going back.\\t0\\nGreat food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.\\t1\\nThe bus boy on the other hand was so rude.\\t0\\nBy this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn\\'t mind making it publicly and loudly known.\\t0\\nBack to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.\\t1\\nAnd considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can\\'t go wrong.\\t1\\nAll the bread is made in-house!\\t1\\nThe only downside is the service.\\t0\\nAlso, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I\\'ve ever had.\\t0\\nService was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.\\t1\\nA couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.\\t1\\nFavorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!\\t1\\nThe black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!\\t1\\nYou won\\'t be disappointed.\\t1\\nThey could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.\\t1\\nI go to far too many places and I\\'ve never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.\\t0\\nWhen my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.\\t0\\nThe servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don\\'t always honor Pizza Hut coupons.\\t0\\nBoth of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.\\t1\\nWe had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.\\t1\\nEverything was gross.\\t0\\nI love this place.\\t1\\nGreat service and food.\\t1\\nFirst - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!\\t0\\nThe burger... I got the \"Gold Standard\" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.\\t0\\nOMG, the food was delicioso!\\t1\\nThere is nothing authentic about this place.\\t0\\nthe spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.\\t0\\nOf all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.\\t1\\nThe vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.\\t1\\nIt\\'s worth driving up from Tucson!\\t1\\nThe selection was probably the worst I\\'ve seen in Vegas.....there was none.\\t0\\nPretty good beer selection too.\\t1\\nThis place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.\\t1\\nClassy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!\\t1\\n5 stars for the brick oven bread app!\\t1\\nI have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.\\t1\\nWe sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.\\t0\\nHe was terrible!\\t0\\nEveryone is treated equally special.\\t1\\nIt shouldn\\'t take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.\\t0\\nIt was delicious!!!\\t1\\nOn the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.\\t1\\nSadly, Gordon Ramsey\\'s Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.\\t0\\nAs always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!\\t1\\nBest fish I\\'ve ever had in my life!\\t1\\n(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)\\t1\\nThe buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.\\t0\\nThis is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.\\t1\\nPretty cool I would say.\\t1\\nDefinitely a turn off for me & i doubt I\\'ll be back unless someone else is buying.\\t0\\nServer did a great job handling our large rowdy table.\\t1\\nI find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn\\'t food.\\t0\\nMy wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.\\t0\\nWould come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.\\t1\\nThe staff are great, the ambiance is great.\\t1\\nHe deserves 5 stars.\\t1\\nI left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.\\t0\\nThey dropped more than the ball.\\t0\\nThe dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.\\t1\\nThey will customize your order any way you\\'d like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!\\t1\\nAnd the beans and rice were mediocre at best.\\t0\\nBest tacos in town by far!!\\t1\\nI took back my money and got outta there.\\t0\\nIn an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.\\t1\\nRUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.\\t0\\nThe staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.\\t0\\nI won\\'t be back.\\t0\\nThey have great dinners.\\t1\\nThe service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.\\t1\\nThe food was terrible.\\t0\\nWILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.\\t0\\nI don\\'t recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.\\t0\\nI will come back here every time I\\'m in Vegas.\\t1\\nThis place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.\\t0\\nThis is a disgrace.\\t0\\nDef coming back to bowl next time\\t1\\nIf you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.\\t1\\nI will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;\\t1\\nI have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.\\t1\\nWe walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.\\t1\\nService was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.\\t1\\nTo summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.\\t1\\nI\\'m probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.\\t0\\nKids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!\\t1\\nService is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.\\t1\\nCooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.\\t1\\nThis one is simply a disappointment.\\t0\\nOverall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.\\t0\\nI don\\'t have to be an accountant to know I\\'m getting screwed!\\t0\\nGreat place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.\\t1\\nToday was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.\\t1\\nLeft very frustrated.\\t0\\nI\\'ll definitely be in soon again.\\t1\\nFood was really good and I got full petty fast.\\t1\\nService was fantastic.\\t1\\nTOTAL WASTE OF TIME.\\t0\\nI don\\'t know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.\\t1\\nCome hungry, leave happy and stuffed!\\t1\\nFor service, I give them no stars.\\t0\\nI can assure you that you won\\'t be disappointed.\\t1\\nI can take a little bad service but the food sucks.\\t0\\nGave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).\\t0\\nBut now I was completely grossed out.\\t0\\nI really enjoyed eating here.\\t1\\nFirst time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.\\t1\\nOur server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.\\t1\\nFrom what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.\\t1\\nOn the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.\\t0\\nFurthermore, you can\\'t even find hours of operation on the website!\\t0\\nWe\\'ve tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we\\'re done with them.\\t0\\nWhat a mistake that was!\\t0\\nNo complaints!\\t1\\nThis is some seriously good pizza and I\\'m an expert/connisseur on the topic.\\t1\\nWaiter was a jerk.\\t0\\nStrike 2, who wants to be rushed.\\t0\\nThese are the nicest restaurant owners I\\'ve ever come across.\\t1\\nI never come again.\\t0\\nWe loved the biscuits!!!\\t1\\nService is quick and friendly.\\t1\\nOrdered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.\\t0\\nSo absolutley fantastic.\\t1\\nIt was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.\\t0\\ndefinitely will come back here again.\\t1\\nI like Steiners because it\\'s dark and it feels like a bar.\\t1\\nWow very spicy but delicious.\\t1\\nIf you\\'re not familiar, check it out.\\t1\\nI\\'ll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.\\t0\\nI\\'d love to go back.\\t1\\nAnyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.\\t1\\nNothing special.\\t0\\nEach day of the week they have a different deal and it\\'s all so delicious!\\t1\\nNot to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!\\t1\\nWill not be back.\\t0\\nSauce was tasteless.\\t0\\nThe food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.\\t1\\nMy ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.\\t1\\nI don\\'t think we\\'ll be going back anytime soon.\\t0\\nFood was so gooodd.\\t1\\nI am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.\\t0\\nI was so insulted.\\t0\\nThe last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.\\t0\\nThe chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.\\t0\\nThe food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.\\t1\\nNargile - I think you are great.\\t1\\nBest tater tots in the southwest.\\t1\\nWe loved the place.\\t1\\nDefinitely not worth the $3 I paid.\\t0\\nThe vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.\\t1\\nIm in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.\\t1\\nThe manager was the worst.\\t0\\nThe inside is really quite nice and very clean.\\t1\\nThe food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.\\t1\\nI don\\'t think I\\'ll be running back to Carly\\'s anytime soon for food.\\t0\\nThis is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.\\t0\\nLove the margaritas, too!\\t1\\nThis was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.\\t1\\nVery good, though!\\t1\\nThe one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.\\t0\\nGreat pork sandwich.\\t1\\nDon\\'t waste your time here.\\t0\\nTotal letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.\\t0\\nThird, the cheese on my friend\\'s burger was cold.\\t0\\nWe enjoy their pizza and brunch.\\t1\\nThe steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.\\t1\\nWe had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.\\t1\\nI LOVED it!\\t1\\nWe asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn\\'t bring that either.\\t0\\nThis place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I\\'ve been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.\\t1\\nSeafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.\\t0\\nThe selection of food was not the best.\\t0\\nDelicious and I will absolutely be back!\\t1\\nThis isn\\'t a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.\\t1\\nThey had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.\\t1\\nI dont think I will be back for a very long time.\\t0\\nIt was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.\\t0\\nHow awesome is that.\\t1\\nI will be back many times soon.\\t1\\nThe menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!\\t1\\nWorse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.\\t0\\nCONCLUSION: Very filling meals.\\t1\\nTheir daily specials are always a hit with my group.\\t1\\nAnd then tragedy struck.\\t0\\nThe pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.\\t1\\nThis was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!\\t1\\nTheir monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.\\t1\\nWaitress was sweet and funny.\\t1\\nI also had to taste my Mom\\'s multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!\\t1\\nI\\'d rather eat airline food, seriously.\\t0\\nCant say enough good things about this place.\\t1\\nThe ambiance was incredible.\\t1\\nThe waitress and manager are so friendly.\\t1\\nI would not recommend this place.\\t0\\nOverall I wasn\\'t very impressed with Noca.\\t0\\nMy gyro was basically lettuce only.\\t0\\nTerrible service!\\t0\\nThoroughly disappointed!\\t0\\nI don\\'t each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.\\t1\\nGive it a try, you will be happy you did.\\t1\\nBy far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!\\t1\\nReasonably priced also!\\t1\\nEverything was perfect the night we were in.\\t1\\nThe food is very good for your typical bar food.\\t1\\nit was a drive to get there.\\t0\\nAt first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.\\t1\\nAnyway, I do not think i will go back there.\\t0\\nPoint your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won\\'t be disappointed.\\t1\\nOh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.\\t1\\nIf you haven\\'t gone here GO NOW!\\t1\\nA greasy, unhealthy meal.\\t0\\nfirst time there and might just be the last.\\t0\\nThose burgers were amazing.\\t1\\nSimilarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.\\t0\\nAnd it was way to expensive.\\t0\\nBe sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.\\t1\\nThis was my first time and I can\\'t wait until the next.\\t1\\nThe bartender was also nice.\\t1\\nEverything was good and tasty!\\t1\\nThis place is two thumbs up....way up.\\t1\\nThe best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.\\t1\\nIf you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.\\t1\\nTerrible management.\\t0\\nAn excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.\\t1\\nIf there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.\\t0\\nGreat steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.\\t1\\nWorst martini ever!\\t0\\nThe steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.\\t1\\nI had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!\\t1\\nWe waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).\\t0\\nThe yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.\\t1\\nI won\\'t try going back there even if it\\'s empty.\\t0\\nNo, I\\'m going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.\\t0\\nJust spicy enough.. Perfect actually.\\t1\\nLast night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!\\t1\\nnot even a \"hello, we will be right with you.\"\\t0\\nThe desserts were a bit strange.\\t0\\nMy boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.\\t1\\nI really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!\\t1\\nNice ambiance.\\t1\\nI would recommend saving room for this!\\t1\\nI guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.\\t0\\nHowever, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.\\t0\\nI know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!\\t0\\nAVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!\\t0\\nI think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.\\t0\\nAll of the tapas dishes were delicious!\\t1\\nI *heart* this place.\\t1\\nMy salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.\\t0\\nAfter two I felt disgusting.\\t0\\nA good time!\\t1\\nI believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.\\t1\\nGenerous portions and great taste.\\t1\\nI will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!\\t0\\nThe servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an \"Are you being helped?\"\\t0\\nFood was delicious!\\t1\\nAN HOUR... seriously?\\t0\\nI consider this theft.\\t0\\nEew... This location needs a complete overhaul.\\t0\\nWe recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.\\t0\\nWaited and waited and waited.\\t0\\nHe also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.\\t1\\nOur server was super nice and checked on us many times.\\t1\\nThe pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.\\t0\\nI swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.\\t0\\nService was good and the company was better!\\t1\\nThe staff are also very friendly and efficient.\\t1\\nAs for the service: I\\'m a fan, because it\\'s quick and you\\'re being served by some nice folks.\\t1\\nBoy was that sucker dry!!.\\t0\\nOver rated.\\t0\\nIf you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.\\t0\\nTheir steaks are 100% recommended!\\t1\\nAfter I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.\\t0\\nGreat food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.\\t1\\nAll in all, I can assure you I\\'ll be back.\\t1\\nI hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.\\t0\\nMy breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.\\t1\\nThe kids play area is NASTY!\\t0\\nGreat place fo take out or eat in.\\t1\\nThe waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.\\t1\\nOMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.\\t1\\nIt was extremely \"crumby\" and pretty tasteless.\\t0\\nIt was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.\\t0\\nThe croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.\\t1\\nI got home to see the driest damn wings ever!\\t0\\nIt\\'ll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!\\t1\\nI really enjoyed Crema CafÃ© before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.\\t1\\nNot good for the money.\\t0\\nI miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!\\t1\\nWe got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.\\t0\\nThey also have the best cheese crisp in town.\\t1\\nGood value, great food, great service.\\t1\\nCouldn\\'t ask for a more satisfying meal.\\t1\\nThe food is good.\\t1\\nIt was awesome.\\t1\\nI just wanted to leave.\\t0\\nWe made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!\\t1\\nI will not be eating there again.\\t0\\n!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!\\t0\\nI checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.\\t0\\nThe chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.\\t0\\nSorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(\\t0\\nAn absolute must visit!\\t1\\nThe cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.\\t1\\nMy friend did not like his Bloody Mary.\\t0\\nDespite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.\\t0\\nThey really want to make your experience a good one.\\t1\\nI will not return.\\t0\\nI had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.\\t0\\nVery disappointing!!!\\t0\\nThe grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.\\t1\\na drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.\\t0\\nPretty awesome place.\\t1\\nAmbience is perfect.\\t1\\nBest of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.\\t0\\nAny grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.\\t0\\nI asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.\\t0\\nThe staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!\\t1\\nFour stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !\\t1\\nThe roast beef sandwich tasted really good!\\t1\\nSame evening, him and I are both drastically sick.\\t0\\nHigh-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.\\t1\\nOrdered burger rare came in we\\'ll done.\\t0\\nWe were promptly greeted and seated.\\t1\\nTried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.\\t0\\nI was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.\\t1\\nAfter waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.\\t0\\nThis is a good joint.\\t1\\nThe Macarons here are insanely good.\\t1\\nI\\'m not eating here!\\t0\\nOur waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.\\t1\\nMaybe if they weren\\'t cold they would have been somewhat edible.\\t0\\nThis place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.\\t0\\nVery bad Experience!\\t0\\nWhat a mistake.\\t0\\nFood was average at best.\\t0\\nGreat food.\\t1\\nWe won\\'t be going back anytime soon!\\t0\\nVery Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.\\t0\\nGreat place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.\\t1\\nIt is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.\\t1\\nNot much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.\\t0\\nThe patio seating was very comfortable.\\t1\\nThe fried rice was dry as well.\\t0\\nHands down my favorite Italian restaurant!\\t1\\nThat just SCREAMS \"LEGIT\" in my book...somethat\\'s also pretty rare here in Vegas.\\t1\\nIt was just not a fun experience.\\t1\\nThe atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.\\t1\\nI personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it\\'s amazing what they do with eggplant!).\\t1\\nVery convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!\\t1\\nThe owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.\\t1\\nBoth great!\\t1\\nEclectic selection.\\t1\\nThe sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.\\t1\\nThe staff was very attentive.\\t1\\nAnd the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).\\t1\\nThe owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.\\t1\\nGoogle mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.\\t0\\ndont go here.\\t0\\nI promise they won\\'t disappoint.\\t1\\nAs a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.\\t0\\nWhat a great double cheeseburger!\\t1\\nAwesome service and food.\\t1\\nA fantastic neighborhood gem !!!\\t1\\nI can\\'t wait to go back.\\t1\\nThe plantains were the worst I\\'ve ever tasted.\\t0\\nIt\\'s a great place and I highly recommend it.\\t1\\nService was slow and not attentive.\\t0\\nI gave it 5 stars then, and I\\'m giving it 5 stars now.\\t1\\nYour staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.\\t0\\nDessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.\\t1\\nVery good food, great atmosphere.1\\t1\\nDamn good steak.\\t1\\nTotal brunch fail.\\t0\\nPrices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.\\t1\\nThe decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.\\t1\\nThe steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!\\t1\\nGood food , good service .\\t1\\nIt was absolutely amazing.\\t1\\nI probably won\\'t be back, to be honest.\\t0\\nwill definitely be back!\\t1\\nThe sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.\\t1\\nHawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I\\'ve tried so far and they\\'re all good.\\t1\\nWent for lunch - service was slow.\\t0\\nWe had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.\\t0\\nI was mortified.\\t0\\nNeedless to say, we will never be back here again.\\t0\\nAnyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.\\t0\\nThe chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.\\t0\\nI wasn\\'t really impressed with Strip Steak.\\t0\\nHave been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!\\t1\\nOur server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.\\t1\\nThe cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.\\t1\\nI work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.\\t0\\nThe atmosphere here is fun.\\t1\\nWould not recommend to others.\\t0\\nService is quick and even \"to go\" orders are just like we like it!\\t1\\nI mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it\\'s so terrible!?!\\t0\\nThat said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.\\t1\\nNot my thing.\\t0\\n2 Thumbs Up!!\\t1\\nIf you are reading this please don\\'t go there.\\t0\\nI loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.\\t1\\nOnly Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!\\t1\\nThey have a really nice atmosphere.\\t1\\nTonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.\\t0\\nAfter one bite, I was hooked.\\t1\\nWe ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.\\t0\\nCute, quaint, simple, honest.\\t1\\nThe chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.\\t1\\nThe food was great as always, compliments to the chef.\\t1\\nSpecial thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.\\t1\\nAwesome selection of beer.\\t1\\nGreat food and awesome service!\\t1\\nOne nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn\\'t expect more tip than that.\\t1\\nA FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!\\t0\\nThe Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.\\t1\\nAs for the service, I thought it was good.\\t1\\nThe food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.\\t0\\nRyan\\'s Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won\\'t be revisiting.\\t0\\nNicest Chinese restaurant I\\'ve been in a while.\\t1\\nOverall, I like there food and the service.\\t1\\nThey also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.\\t1\\nProbably never coming back, and wouldn\\'t recommend it.\\t0\\nFriend\\'s pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.\\t0\\nTry them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.\\t1\\nI love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.\\t1\\nNever had anything to complain about here.\\t1\\nThe restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.\\t1\\nIt was way over fried.\\t0\\nI\\'m not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.\\t0\\nWhen I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.\\t0\\nWill not be back!\\t0\\nThere was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.\\t1\\nAn extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.\\t1\\nI always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.\\t1\\nI have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!\\t0\\nWonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.\\t1\\nI got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.\\t1\\nThe wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.\\t1\\nLevel 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn\\'t over-whelm the soup.\\t1\\nWe were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!\\t1\\nMain thing I didn\\'t enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.\\t0\\nWhen I\\'m on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I\\'ll hit up again!\\t1\\nI had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.\\t0\\nThis is a GREAT place to eat!\\t1\\nThe jalapeno bacon is soooo good.\\t1\\nThe service was poor and thats being nice.\\t0\\nFood was good, service was good, Prices were good.\\t1\\nThe place was not clean and the food oh so stale!\\t0\\nThe chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.\\t0\\nBut the service was beyond bad.\\t0\\nI\\'m so happy to be here!!!\"\\t1\\nTasted like dirt.\\t0\\nOne of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .\\t1\\nThe block was amazing.\\t1\\nIt\\'s close to my house, it\\'s low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.\\t1\\n* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!\\t1\\nMy sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.\\t0\\nGreat time - family dinner on a Sunday night.\\t1\\nthe food is not tasty at all, not to say its \"real traditional Hunan style\".\\t0\\nWhat did bother me, was the slow service.\\t0\\nThe flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!\\t1\\nTheir frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.\\t0\\nThese were so good we ordered them twice.\\t1\\nSo in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.\\t0\\nMy girlfriend\\'s veal was very bad.\\t0\\nUnfortunately, it was not good.\\t0\\nI had a pretty satifying experience.\\t1\\nJoin the club and get awesome offers via email.\\t1\\nPerfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.\\t1\\nBland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.\\t0\\nThe chains, which I\\'m no fan of, beat this place easily.\\t0\\nThe nachos are a MUST HAVE!\\t1\\nWe will not be coming back.\\t0\\nI don\\'t have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.\\t1\\nThe staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.\\t1\\nGreat atmosphere, friendly and fast service.\\t1\\nWhen I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.\\t1\\nOnce your food arrives it\\'s meh.\\t0\\nPaying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid\\'s meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.\\t0\\nThe classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.\\t1\\nMy brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.\\t0\\nSo good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.\\t1\\nThe chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.\\t1\\nThis place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\t1\\nMediocre food.\\t0\\nOnce you get inside you\\'ll be impressed with the place.\\t1\\nI\\'m super pissd.\\t0\\nAnd service was super friendly.\\t1\\nWhy are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?\\t0\\nThis place was such a nice surprise!\\t1\\nThey were golden-crispy and delicious.\\t1\\nI had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.\\t0\\nI could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.\\t1\\nNot a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.\\t0\\nLastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.\\t1\\nThe first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.\\t1\\nThe server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!\\t0\\nThe service was terrible though.\\t0\\nThis place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!\\t0\\nIt was packed!!\\t0\\nI love this place.\\t1\\nI can say that the desserts were yummy.\\t1\\nThe food was terrible.\\t0\\nThe seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.\\t1\\nIt kept getting worse and worse so now I\\'m officially done.\\t0\\nThis place should honestly be blown up.\\t0\\nBut I definitely would not eat here again.\\t0\\nDo not waste your money here!\\t0\\nI love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.\\t1\\nThe crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist.\\t1\\nAwful service.\\t0\\nWon\\'t ever go here again.\\t0\\nFood quality has been horrible.\\t0\\nFor that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.\\t0\\nThe service here is fair at best.\\t0\\nI do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.\\t0\\nDo yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.\\t0\\nVery poor service.\\t0\\nNo one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.\\t0\\nBest service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.\\t1\\nThey were excellent.\\t1\\nI paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.\\t0\\nJust had lunch here and had a great experience.\\t1\\nI have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.\\t0\\nFood is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.\\t0\\nI recently tried Caballero\\'s and I have been back every week since!\\t1\\nfor 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.\\t0\\nThe food came out at a good pace.\\t1\\nI ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.\\t1\\nI won\\'t be back.\\t0\\nWe could not believe how dirty the oysters were!\\t0\\nThis place deserves no stars.\\t0\\nI would not recommend this place.\\t0\\nIn fact I\\'m going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.\\t1\\nTo my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.\\t0\\nBad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!\\t0\\nthe potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.\\t1\\nI probably would not go here again.\\t0\\nSo flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.\\t1\\nThe price is reasonable and the service is great.\\t1\\nThe Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.\\t0\\nMy fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn\\'t look too appealing.\\t0\\nWent in for happy hour, great list of wines.\\t1\\nSome may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!\\t1\\nI probably won\\'t be coming back here.\\t0\\nWorst food/service I\\'ve had in a while.\\t0\\nThis place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.\\t1\\nTalk about great customer service of course we will be back.\\t1\\nHot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.\\t0\\nI love their fries and their beans.\\t1\\nAlways a pleasure dealing with him.\\t1\\nThey have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I\\'ve tried gets my seal of approval.\\t1\\nThis place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.\\t1\\nFor sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.\\t1\\nThe service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.\\t1\\nThe feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.\\t0\\nI started this review with two stars, but I\\'m editing it to give it only one.\\t0\\nthis is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco\\'s.\\t0\\nAll in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.\\t1\\nMy boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.\\t1\\nWeird vibe from owners.\\t0\\nThere was hardly any meat.\\t0\\nI\\'ve had better bagels from the grocery store.\\t0\\nGo To Place for Gyros.\\t1\\nI love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!\\t1\\nNow the burgers aren\\'t as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.\\t0\\nI found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.\\t0\\nThe service was terrible, food was mediocre.\\t0\\nWe definately enjoyed ourselves.\\t1\\nI ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.\\t0\\nOn three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.\\t0\\nI had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.\\t0\\nThe service was extremely slow.\\t0\\nAfter 20 minutes wait, I got a table.\\t0\\nSeriously killer hot chai latte.\\t1\\nNo allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.\\t0\\nMy boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.\\t1\\nTheir rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.\\t1\\nPricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.\\t0\\nWorst Thai ever.\\t0\\nIf you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.\\t1\\nI want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.\\t1\\nThe pizza selections are good.\\t1\\nI had strawberry tea, which was good.\\t1\\nHighly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!\\t0\\nOverall, a great experience.\\t1\\nSpend your money elsewhere.\\t0\\nTheir regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!\\t1\\nThe Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.\\t0\\nAnd the drinks are WEAK, people!\\t0\\n-My order was not correct.\\t0\\nAlso, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.\\t0\\nAfter the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.\\t0\\nThe chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\t1\\nWe won\\'t be returning.\\t0\\nThis is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.\\t1\\nI seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.\\t0\\nVery, very sad.\\t0\\ni felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?\\t0\\nHow can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can\\'t properly cook a steak, I don\\'t understand!\\t0\\nI\\'m not impressed with the concept or the food.\\t0\\nThe only thing I wasn\\'t too crazy about was their guacamole as I don\\'t like it purÃ©ed.\\t0\\nThere is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better\\t0\\nI got food poisoning here at the buffet.\\t0\\nThey brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!\\t0\\nWhat SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.\\t0\\nNeedless to say, I won\\'t be going back anytime soon.\\t0\\nThis place is disgusting!\\t0\\nEvery time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.\\t1\\nThe RI style calamari was a joke.\\t0\\nHowever, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.\\t0\\nI could barely stomach the meal, but didn\\'t complain because it was a business lunch.\\t0\\nIt was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.\\t0\\nIt also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.\\t0\\nWe aren\\'t ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don\\'t get it...definitely lost the love after this one!\\t0\\nDisappointing experience.\\t0\\nThe food is about on par with Denny\\'s, which is to say, not good at all.\\t0\\nIf you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.\\t0\\nWAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.\\t0\\nWe won\\'t be going back.\\t0\\nThe place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn\\'t worth it.\\t0\\nThis place lacked style!!\\t0\\nThe sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.\\t0\\nDon\\'t bother coming here.\\t0\\nThe meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.\\t0\\nThe building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn\\'t eat here again.\\t0\\nIt was equally awful.\\t0\\nProbably not in a hurry to go back.\\t0\\nvery slow at seating even with reservation.\\t0\\nNot good by any stretch of the imagination.\\t0\\nThe cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.\\t0\\nThe chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.\\t0\\nIt was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.\\t0\\nI was VERY disappointed!!\\t0\\nThis place is horrible and way overpriced.\\t0\\nMaybe it\\'s just their Vegetarian fare, but I\\'ve been twice and I thought it was average at best.\\t0\\nIt wasn\\'t busy at all and now we know why.\\t0\\nThe tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.\\t0\\nThe ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.\\t0\\nCon: spotty service.\\t0\\nThe fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.\\t0\\nBut then they came back cold.\\t0\\nThen our food came out, disappointment ensued.\\t0\\nThe real disappointment was our waiter.\\t0\\nMy husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.\\t0\\nThe only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.\\t0\\nInsults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.\\t0\\nIf someone orders two tacos don\\'t\\' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?\\t0\\nShe was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.\\t0\\nAfter all the rave reviews I couldn\\'t wait to eat here......what a disappointment!\\t0\\nDel Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.\\t0\\nIt\\'s NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.\\t0\\nBut I don\\'t like it.\\t0\\nHell no will I go back\\t0\\nWe\\'ve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.\\t0\\nI don\\'t know what the big deal is about this place, but I won\\'t be back \"ya\\'all\".\\t0\\nI immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.\\t0\\nThe ambiance isn\\'t much better.\\t0\\nUnfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.\\t0\\nThe food wasn\\'t good.\\t0\\nYour servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.\\t0\\nWhat happened next was pretty....off putting.\\t0\\ntoo bad cause I know it\\'s family owned, I really wanted to like this place.\\t0\\nOverpriced for what you are getting.\\t0\\nI vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.\\t0\\nI kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.\\t0\\nI have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.\\t0\\nWe started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn\\'t fresh.\\t0\\nFood was below average.\\t0\\nIt sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.\\t0\\nAll in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.\\t0\\nThe problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).\\t0\\nShrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.\\t0\\nIt lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.\\t0\\nIt really is impressive that the place hasn\\'t closed down.\\t0\\nI would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.\\t0\\nThe refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.\\t0\\nSpend your money and time some place else.\\t0\\nA lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.\\t0\\nthe presentation of the food was awful.\\t0\\nI can\\'t tell you how disappointed I was.\\t0\\nI think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.\\t0\\nAppetite instantly gone.\\t0\\nOverall I was not impressed and would not go back.\\t0\\nThe whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we\\'ll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.\\t0\\nThen, as if I hadn\\'t wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.\\t0\\n\\nA very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  \\t0\\nNot sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  \\t0\\nAttempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  \\t0\\nVery little music or anything to speak of.  \\t0\\nThe best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  \\t1\\nThe rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it\\'s about emptiness, it works I guess because it\\'s empty.  \\t0\\nWasted two hours.  \\t0\\nSaw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  \\t1\\nA bit predictable.  \\t0\\nLoved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  \\t1\\nAnd those baby owls were adorable.  \\t1\\nThe movie showed a lot of Florida at it\\'s best, made it look very appealing.  \\t1\\nThe Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  \\t1\\nIt Was So Cool.  \\t1\\nThis is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  \\t1\\nIt had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  \\t0\\nThis review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  \\t1\\nI\\'ll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces.  \\t1\\n The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  \\t1\\nI can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  \\t1\\nIn other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  \\t1\\nHow can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  \\t1\\nIt\\'s quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  \\t1\\nYes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  \\t1\\nThis short film certainly pulls no punches.  \\t0\\nGraphics is far from the best part of the game.  \\t0\\nThis is the number one best TH game in the series.  \\t1\\nIt deserves strong love.  \\t1\\nIt is an insane game.  \\t1\\nThere are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it\\'s just a massive game.  \\t1\\nWaste your money on this game.  \\t1\\nThis is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  \\t1\\nActually, the graphics were good at the time.  \\t1\\nToday the graphics are crap.  \\t0\\nAs they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  \\t1\\nThis game rocks.  \\t1\\nBuy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s PURE BRILLIANCE.  \\t1\\nThis was a flick doomed from its conception.  \\t0\\nThe very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  \\t0\\nI wasn\\'t the least bit interested.  \\t0\\nNot only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I\\'m not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  \\t0\\nBut it\\'s just not funny.  \\t0\\nBut even the talented Carrell can\\'t save this.  \\t0\\nHis co-stars don\\'t fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  \\t0\\nThe story itself is just predictable and lazy.  \\t0\\nThe only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I\\'ve ever seen.  \\t0\\nBut whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn\\'t translate to quality, that\\'s for sure.  \\t0\\nThe film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  \\t1\\nI\\'m glad the film didn\\'t go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  \\t1\\nIn addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  \\t1\\nOn the negative, it\\'s insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  \\t0\\nLong, whiny and pointless.  \\t0\\nBut I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  \\t0\\nExcellent cast, story line, performances.  \\t1\\nTotally believable.  \\t1\\nAnne Heche was utterly convincing.  \\t1\\nSam Shepard\\'s portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  \\t1\\nI sat riveted to the TV screen.  \\t1\\nAll in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  \\t1\\nI do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  \\t1\\nI enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  \\t1\\nI was very disappointed in the movie.  \\t0\\nOne character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  \\t0\\nThere is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  \\t0\\nThere was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  \\t0\\nThis movie totally grates on my nerves.  \\t0\\nThe performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they\\'re delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  \\t0\\nAnd, quite honestly, often its not very good.  \\t0\\nOften the dialogue doesn\\'t really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  \\t0\\nIt crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  \\t0\\nThere are some generally great things in it.  \\t1\\nI wouldn\\'t say they\\'re worth 2 hours of your time, though.  \\t0\\nThe suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  \\t1\\nI especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  \\t1\\nIf you want a movie that\\'s not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  \\t1\\nAlexander Nevsky is a great film.  \\t1\\nHe is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  \\t1\\nI\\'m glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn\\'t do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It\\'s gonna help movie makers who aren\\'t in the very restrained movie business of QuÃ©bec.  \\t0\\nThis if the first movie I\\'ve given a 10 to in years.  \\t1\\nIf there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  \\t1\\nOverall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  \\t1\\nPlus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  \\t1\\nGive this one a look.  \\t1\\nI gave it a 10  \\t1\\nThe Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  \\t1\\nIt is a true classic.  \\t1\\nIt actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  \\t1\\nDefinitely worth checking out.  \\t1\\nThe problem was the script.  \\t0\\nIt was horrendous.  \\t0\\nThere was NOTHING believable about it at all.  \\t0\\nThe only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  \\t0\\nMANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  \\t1\\nThe scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  \\t1\\nThe cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  \\t1\\nUrsula Burton\\'s portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  \\t1\\nIf you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of The Way You Look Tonight), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  \\t1\\nI don\\'t think you will be disappointed.  \\t1\\nFrankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  \\t0\\nThe acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  \\t0\\nIt was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  \\t0\\nToo politically correct.  \\t0\\nVery disappointing.  \\t0\\nThe only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  \\t1\\nI love Lane, but I\\'ve never seen her in a movie this lousy.  \\t0\\nAn hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  \\t0\\nBut in terms of the writing it\\'s very fresh and bold.  \\t1\\nThe acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  \\t1\\nThe directing and the cinematography aren\\'t quite as good.  \\t0\\nThe movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  \\t0\\n), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  \\t0\\nThe directing seems too pretentious.  \\t0\\nThe scenes with the oh-so-mature neighbour-girl are a misplace.  \\t0\\nAnd generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  \\t0\\nThen scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  \\t0\\nSome applause should be given to the prelude however.  \\t1\\nI really liked that.  \\t1\\nA great film by a great director.  \\t1\\nThe movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  \\t1\\nThe music in the film is really nice too.  \\t1\\nI\\'d advise anyone to go and see it.  \\t1\\nBrilliant!  \\t1\\n10/10  \\t1\\nI liked this movie way too much.  \\t1\\nMy only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  \\t0\\nIt rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  \\t1\\nHowever, this didn\\'t make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  \\t0\\nThere was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn\\'t understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  \\t0\\nThere were several moments in the movie that just didn\\'t need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  \\t0\\nThis was a poor remake of My Best Friends Wedding.  \\t0\\nAll in all, a great disappointment.  \\t0\\nI cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film.  \\t0\\nI could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  \\t0\\nI guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  \\t0\\nIMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it\\'s time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  \\t0\\nI saw Mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  \\t0\\nUnfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  \\t0\\nThese are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  \\t0\\nAll the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  \\t0\\nIt is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  \\t0\\nYou can\\'t relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  \\t0\\nThis is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  \\t1\\nThis movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  \\t0\\nThe fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  \\t0\\nA truly, truly bad film.  \\t0\\nThe acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  \\t0\\nThe only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  \\t0\\nI paid too much.  \\t0\\nAlso, it\\'s a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  \\t1\\nIt was so BORING!  \\t0\\nNo plot whatsoever!  \\t0\\nAgain, no plot at all.  \\t0\\nHorrible!  \\t0\\nWorst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  \\t0\\nI had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  \\t0\\nI hate movies like that.  \\t0\\nYeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  \\t0\\nTHERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  \\t0\\nIf you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  \\t0\\nAwful.  \\t0\\nI don\\'t think I\\'ve ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  \\t0\\nIt was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I\\'d have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  \\t0\\nNOBODY identifies with these characters because they\\'re all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  \\t0\\nThis is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can\\'t handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  \\t0\\nCrash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  \\t0\\nStill, I do like this movie for it\\'s empowerment of women; there\\'s not enough movies out there like this one.  \\t1\\nYour brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  \\t0\\nI was left shattered from the experience of watching this \\'film\\' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  \\t0\\nThis movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  \\t0\\nI certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  \\t0\\nI mean this in a terrible way.  \\t0\\nThis film has no redeeming features.  \\t0\\nEverything is appalling.  \\t0\\nArtless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  \\t0\\nThe story is beyond stupid.  \\t0\\nThe script isÂ…was there a script?  \\t0\\nThe kids are annoying.  \\t0\\nThe lead man is charisma-free.  \\t0\\nUtterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  \\t0\\nI\\'ll even say it again Â– this is torture.  \\t0\\nMaybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  \\t0\\nNot a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  \\t0\\nHighly unrecommended.  \\t0\\nIf this premise sound stupid, that\\'s because it is.  \\t0\\nYes, it\\'s that bad.  \\t0\\nNothing at all to recommend.  \\t0\\nAn excellent performance from Ms.  \\t1\\nGarbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn\\'t seem to be stocking them.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn\\'t missed a step going from silent to sound.  \\t1\\nThis movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  \\t0\\nThere were too many close ups.  \\t0\\nBut other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn\\'t really work for their freedom.  \\t0\\nBut this movie is definitely a below average rent.  \\t0\\nYou\\'ll love it!  \\t1\\nThis movie is BAD.  \\t0\\nSo bad.  \\t0\\nThe film is way too long.  \\t0\\nThis is definitely one of the bad ones.  \\t0\\nThe movie I received was a great quality film for it\\'s age.  \\t1\\nJohn Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  \\t1\\nHis on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  \\t1\\nI think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  \\t1\\nI really don\\'t see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  \\t0\\nI don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  \\t0\\nIt probably would have been better if the director hadn\\'t spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn\\'t that noteworthy.  \\t0\\nAnother thing I didn\\'t really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  \\t0\\nJamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  \\t1\\nHis performance is simply genius.  \\t1\\nHe owns the film, just as Spacek owned Coal Miner\\'s Daughter and Quaid owned Great Balls of Fire.  \\t1\\n In fact, it\\'s hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  \\t1\\nRay Charles is legendary.  \\t1\\nRay Charles\\' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  \\t1\\nHitchcock is a great director.  \\t1\\nIronically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  \\t0\\nSecondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  \\t0\\nHence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  \\t0\\nThe plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  \\t0\\nThere are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  \\t0\\nMishima is extremely uninteresting.  \\t0\\nThis is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  \\t0\\nThe flat reenactments don\\'t hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  \\t0\\nAnd the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  \\t0\\nHe can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  \\t0\\nSchrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  \\t0\\nWhen I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  \\t1\\nI was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  \\t1\\nHowever, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  \\t0\\nI mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  \\t0\\nThe character developments also lacked in depth.  \\t0\\nWoa, talk about awful.  \\t0\\nDo not waste your time.  \\t0\\nIt was just too horrible.  \\t0\\nThe worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  \\t0\\nBut what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  \\t0\\nThe poor actors.  \\t0\\nYou can\\'t even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  \\t0\\nIf you check the director\\'s filmography on this site you will see why this film didn\\'t have a chance.  \\t0\\nThis would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  \\t0\\nIf good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  \\t1\\nThe film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  \\t1\\nRegrettably, the film fails.  \\t0\\nThe movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  \\t0\\nNo actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  \\t0\\nYet, I enjoy watching it.  \\t1\\nUnfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  \\t0\\nBad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  \\t0\\nThe dialogue sucked.  \\t0\\nThe cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  \\t0\\nThe soundtrack sucked.  \\t0\\nThe acting sucked.  \\t0\\nThe concert sequences just sucked.  \\t0\\nThat was nice.  \\t1\\nThat was funny.  \\t1\\nIt was so funny.  \\t1\\nOverall, this movie was cheap trash.  \\t0\\nBut this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  \\t0\\nI came out of it feeling angry.  \\t0\\n***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can\\'t) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  \\t1\\nThe cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  \\t1\\nConceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  \\t1\\nAnd there wasn\\'t a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  \\t1\\nAll things considered, a job very well done.  \\t1\\nThanks good a movie like this was done and released.  \\t1\\nOne of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  \\t1\\nIt ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  \\t1\\nThe attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  \\t1\\nIt is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  \\t1\\nUp there with the best of Melville.  \\t1\\nEverything about this film is simply incredible.  \\t1\\nYou truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  \\t1\\nBLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it\\'s limitations (it\\'s an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  \\t1\\nThe performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that\\'s because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  \\t1\\nI thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  \\t1\\nI\\'m not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  \\t0\\nIf it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  \\t0\\nThere is a lot of beautiful places.  \\t1\\nIt was forced, like everything in this movie.  \\t0\\nAgain, lame.  \\t0\\nHere\\'s where the movie really pi**ed me off.  \\t0\\nAnd don\\'t even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  \\t0\\nWhen I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  \\t0\\nSummary: The witticisms weren\\'t witty.  \\t0\\nThe plot - well, I said I\\'d let that one go.  \\t0\\nThe acting was bad.  \\t0\\nReally bad.  \\t0\\nEven Billy Bob couldn\\'t rise above the script, which was worse.  \\t0\\nCamerawork - again, bad.  \\t0\\nRating: 1 out of 10.  \\t0\\nAn AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  \\t1\\nKieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  \\t1\\nHe is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  \\t1\\nHis use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  \\t1\\nThree of the most visually appealing movies i\\'ve ever seen.  \\t1\\nAnd his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  \\t1\\nI have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  \\t1\\nI couldn\\'t think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  \\t1\\nI recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  \\t1\\n10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  \\t1\\nI literally vomited while watching this film.  \\t0\\nI think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth\\'s pearls.  \\t1\\nhis performance, as awarded, was stunning.  \\t1\\nthe story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  \\t1\\nIn a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  \\t1\\nAll in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola\\'s roeg wih a sublime cast.  \\t1\\nI\\'m translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  \\t0\\nBut when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap.  \\t0\\nTo those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it\\'s your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it\\'s in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  \\t0\\nOne more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I\\'m all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  \\t0\\nThis is such a fun and funny movie.  \\t1\\nHighly entertaining at all angles.  \\t1\\nIt features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  \\t1\\nSo for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  \\t1\\nIt even has its sweet moments.  \\t1\\nThe telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  \\t1\\nAll the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  \\t1\\nAnd I really did find them funny.  \\t1\\nThis is actually a very smart movie.  \\t1\\nThere is a brilliant twist ending.  \\t1\\n I love it.  \\t1\\nThe ending is so, SO perfect... you\\'ll shed a tear.  \\t1\\nI am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  \\t1\\nI will never forget it now.  \\t1\\nIt is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  \\t1\\nWhich has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  \\t0\\nThe Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  \\t0\\nThis movie is terrible.  \\t0\\nThe hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they\\'re 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  \\t0\\nFor those that haven\\'t seen it, don\\'t waste your time!  \\t0\\nTo call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  \\t0\\nStarted watching this but didn\\'t believe in any of the characters.  \\t0\\nIn particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn\\'t work for me at all.  \\t0\\nIt was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  \\t0\\nThe characters were very \\'stagey\\' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  \\t0\\nBy the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn\\'t care what happened next and so I switched off.  \\t0\\nGlad I didn\\'t pay to see it.  \\t0\\nDidn\\'t laugh or even smile once.  \\t0\\nBut it wasn\\'t anything at all just one big yawn...  \\t0\\nIt is a really good show to watch.  \\t1\\nIt is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  \\t1\\nBarney is definitely super DE duper.  \\t1\\nis pretty funny.  \\t1\\nBabie Bop is very cute.  \\t1\\nThe kids are very cool too.  \\t1\\n But Storm Trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  \\t0\\nIt\\'s just lame.  \\t0\\nThe guy who said he\\'s had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  \\t0\\nEverything about this movie is stupid.  \\t0\\nEven if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  \\t0\\nIt is shameful.  \\t0\\nI would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  \\t1\\nThe writers were smack on and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  \\t1\\nI must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  \\t1\\nNow you know why I gave it a 10+!  \\t1\\nI don\\'t know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family\\'s memories.  \\t1\\nI totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  \\t1\\nThe things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  \\t1\\nThis is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  \\t1\\nMuch more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  \\t1\\nEverything from acting to cinematography was solid.  \\t1\\nDefinitely worth checking out.  \\t1\\nDamian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  \\t1\\nThis movie has a cutting edge to it.  \\t1\\nI am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  \\t1\\nThe new characters weren\\'t all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  \\t0\\nI felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  \\t0\\nIt didn\\'t make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  \\t0\\nThe jerky camera movements were also annoying.  \\t0\\nThe plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  \\t0\\nThere was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn\\'t really work into the rest of the plot.  \\t0\\nI guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  \\t0\\nIf you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  \\t0\\nElias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  \\t1\\nThis was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  \\t1\\nI really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  \\t1\\nThis totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  \\t0\\nLucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  \\t0\\nAll this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  \\t0\\nGod, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  \\t0\\nI think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of wonder) are the excerpts from his works.  \\t1\\nThe sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  \\t1\\nThey could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  \\t1\\nThe stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  \\t1\\nAfter watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.  \\t1\\nI highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  \\t1\\nHere, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America\\'s own Imperial age.  \\t1\\n) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  \\t1\\nThough The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery\\'s noble brigand, Candace Bergen\\'s feisty heroine, John Huston\\'s wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly\\'s spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt\\'s Big Stick.  \\t1\\nThis is high adventure at its best.  \\t1\\nI think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  \\t1\\nHaving to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  \\t1\\n(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  \\t1\\nAlmost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  \\t0\\nThe most annoying thing about \\'Cover Girl\\' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  \\t0\\nUnfortunately, \\'Cover Girl\\' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  \\t0\\nNon-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  \\t1\\nThe good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  \\t1\\nA good commentary of today\\'s love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  \\t1\\nFor people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  \\t1\\nIt was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s a feel-good film and that\\'s how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  \\t1\\nIt has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  \\t1\\nI rather enjoyed it.  \\t1\\nI liked it.  \\t1\\nI couldn\\'t take them seriously.  \\t0\\nIt really created a unique feeling though.  \\t1\\nVivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  \\t1\\nA world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  \\t1\\nHer role was played well.  \\t1\\nNot too screamy not to masculine but just right.  \\t1\\nThe camera really likes her in this movie.  \\t1\\nI would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  \\t1\\nAs a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980\\'s and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  \\t1\\nI am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  \\t0\\nEven worse than Ticker!  \\t0\\n& That movie was bad.  \\t0\\nOnly like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  \\t0\\nIt just blew.  \\t0\\nThis movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing \\'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before\\'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  \\t1\\nI just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughed,kids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes out,it has new features!  \\t1\\nNow we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  \\t0\\nThis show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere.  \\t0\\nAlmost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  \\t0\\nI wish I could enter negative values, admins?  \\t0\\nThe sets are so bad, they wouldn\\'t look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  \\t0\\nThe use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  \\t0\\nOh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  \\t0\\nI hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don\\'t believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  \\t0\\nI am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I\\'d spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  \\t0\\nIn short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  \\t0\\nIt came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  \\t0\\n1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  \\t0\\nAn interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I\\'d love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  \\t1\\nThe soundtrack wasn\\'t terrible, either.  \\t1\\nBut the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  \\t0\\nStill, it was the SETS that got a big 10 on my oy-vey scale.  \\t1\\nYes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  \\t0\\nBoth do good jobs and are quite amusing.  \\t1\\nBut the convoluted plot just didn\\'t convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  \\t0\\nI let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  \\t0\\nThe last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  \\t1\\nBela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  \\t0\\nThe acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  \\t0\\nI like Armand Assante & my cable company\\'s summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  \\t1\\nI believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  \\t1\\nMy 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  \\t1\\nI won\\'t say any more - I don\\'t like spoilers, so I don\\'t want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  \\t1\\nWow, what a bad film.  \\t0\\nNot frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  \\t0\\nThe plot doesn\\'t hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  \\t0\\nNot even good for camp value!  \\t0\\nI wasn\\'t expecting Oscar material, but this?  \\t0\\nYou\\'d have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  \\t0\\nThis film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  \\t0\\nIf only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  \\t0\\nThis gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there\\'s nothing lower.  \\t0\\nThis is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  \\t0\\nI know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  \\t0\\nVictor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  \\t0\\nConsidering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  \\t0\\nBut the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  \\t0\\nThe death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  \\t0\\nThe only thing worse than Taylor\\'s acting was Stanwyck\\'s singing.  \\t0\\nWhatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  \\t0\\nI was deeply impressed with the character he played.  \\t1\\nI knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  \\t1\\nA cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  \\t0\\nEven the squibs look awful.  \\t0\\nAt no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  \\t0\\nThe plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  \\t0\\nThe awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  \\t0\\nI was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  \\t0\\nThe dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  \\t0\\nAbout 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  \\t0\\nThe directing is sloppy at best.  \\t0\\nHackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  \\t0\\nOf course, the acting is blah.  \\t0\\nThe acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  \\t0\\nAnd, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would\\'ve been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  \\t0\\nI loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it\\'s share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  \\t1\\nI have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  \\t1\\nThis movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven\\'t seen before.  \\t1\\nThis movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  \\t1\\nOverall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  \\t1\\nLifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  \\t1\\nI particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  \\t0\\nIt is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  \\t0\\nTotally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  \\t1\\nThis movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  \\t1\\nBut this movie really got to me.  \\t1\\nSee it.  \\t1\\nI really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  \\t1\\nAnd I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa AurvÃ¥g being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn\\'t understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  \\t1\\nThis movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  \\t1\\nI found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  \\t1\\nInitially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  \\t1\\nLater I found myself lost in the power of the film.  \\t1\\nThe entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  \\t1\\nI left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  \\t1\\nDuris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  \\t1\\nThe rest of the cast also play well.  \\t1\\nCinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  \\t1\\nAbout ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  \\t0\\nAbout half way through this film I started to dislike it.  \\t0\\nBy the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  \\t0\\nWhat this film lacks is a convincing script.  \\t0\\nThe script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  \\t0\\nThings happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  \\t0\\nThe cast is good.  \\t1\\nFor that, it\\'s worth checking out.  \\t1\\nThis is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  \\t0\\nIt is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  \\t0\\nEverything about it is just bad.  \\t0\\nI could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  \\t0\\nThe script is bad, very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  \\t0\\nThe casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  \\t0\\nFinal Word: This Show is a real torture!!  \\t0\\nIt is zillion times away from reality.  \\t0\\nWatching washing machine twirling around wouldn\\'t hurt your eyes as much as this show.  \\t0\\nRating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  \\t0\\n20th Century Fox\\'s ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  \\t0\\nFull of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  \\t0\\nFrom here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  \\t0\\nHis losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  \\t0\\nAnd if that isn\\'t enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  \\t0\\nWhatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  \\t0\\n(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  \\t0\\nthere are so many problems i dont know where to start.  \\t0\\nthe cast was great.  \\t1\\nsteve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.  \\t1\\nadd betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  \\t1\\nbut the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  \\t0\\nfirst of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  \\t0\\nthe movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  \\t0\\nputting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa\\'s character.  \\t0\\nthere is no real plot.  \\t0\\ni wouldnt see this movie again for free.  \\t0\\nSTEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  \\t1\\nThis second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  \\t1\\nWhile you don\\'t yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  \\t1\\nHowever, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s just adorable seeing Mickey playing Turkey in the Straw in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  \\t1\\nClever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey\\'s best films even after 80 wonderful years.  \\t1\\nThe bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv\\'s diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  \\t0\\nI\\'m terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  \\t0\\nThe original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  \\t1\\nJohn Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  \\t1\\nI don\\'t think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  \\t0\\nThis may be the only bad film he ever made.  \\t0\\nSo bad...well...it\\'s just bad.  \\t0\\nThis movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  \\t0\\nIt\\'s a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  \\t0\\nI thought it was bad.  \\t0\\nBoth films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  \\t0\\nLet\\'s start with all the problemsÂ—the acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  \\t0\\nThe script is a big flawed mess.  \\t0\\nThe best example of how dumb the writing is when it\\'s established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  \\t0\\nDirector Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie Grim, clearly doesn\\'t know how to pace his films.  \\t0\\nThe movie is terribly boring in places.  \\t0\\nThe lighting is awful.  \\t0\\nThe film looks cheap and bland.  \\t0\\nOne of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  \\t0\\nThis convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn\\'t work here.  \\t0\\nThe visual effects were AWFUL.  \\t0\\nThe CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God\\'s sake!  \\t0\\nThe explosion of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  \\t0\\nOkay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I\\'ll give credit where credit\\'s due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  \\t1\\nGotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  \\t1\\nTo sum the film up, Breeders is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  \\t0\\nNot recommended.  \\t0\\nHe is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  \\t0\\nAside from it\\'s terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  \\t0\\nI understand that it\\'s supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn\\'t mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  \\t0\\nLewis Black\\'s considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won\\'t allow.  \\t0\\nThe film\\'s sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  \\t1\\nWith the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  \\t0\\nThe budget was evidently very limited.  \\t0\\nThis was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  \\t0\\nHowever, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  \\t0\\nFilmiing was less expansive.  \\t0\\nIt failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  \\t0\\nGenerally; it just lacked imagination.  \\t0\\nNot recommended.  \\t0\\nIs it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  \\t0\\nThere is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  \\t0\\nEven when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  \\t0\\nBeware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  \\t0\\nI can\\'t believe there\\'s even a sequel to this!  \\t0\\nWhich is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  \\t0\\nBeing a 90\\'s child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  \\t1\\nBut Tiny Toons kept the 90\\'s vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  \\t1\\nThe memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  \\t1\\nEasily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  \\t1\\nThe characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  \\t1\\nEvery single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  \\t1\\nEvery element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  \\t0\\nHer lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  \\t0\\nPerabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  \\t1\\nThere is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  \\t0\\nI saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  \\t0\\nWhat is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  \\t0\\nTo be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  \\t0\\nIn conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  \\t0\\nThe story line is just awful!  \\t0\\nIt\\'s just painful!  \\t0\\nAnd the accents are absolutely abysmal!  \\t0\\nThere\\'s also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  \\t0\\nDon\\'t waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  \\t0\\nI believe that Pitch Black was done well.  \\t1\\nThe characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn\\'t make it.  \\t1\\nGo watch it!  \\t1\\nOmit watching this.  \\t0\\nVERY funny!  \\t1\\nMy rating: just 3 out of 10.  \\t0\\nThe characters are interesting and you really care for them.  \\t1\\nAn instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  \\t1\\nDon\\'t miss it.  \\t1\\nThis is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet\\'s bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  \\t1\\nA mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  \\t1\\nBut above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master\\'s work.  \\t1\\nThe basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  \\t0\\nRegardless, the film fails on most levels.  \\t0\\nAvoid at all costs.  \\t0\\nI saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  \\t1\\nI thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  \\t1\\nHis acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  \\t1\\nI had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  \\t1\\nBut it wasn\\'t until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  \\t1\\nI\\'ll give this film 10 out of 10!  \\t1\\nI know that Jim O\\'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  \\t0\\nHe really didn\\'t seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn\\'t get involved with the guests.  \\t0\\nLovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  \\t1\\nJimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock\\'s black and white, low-budget original.  \\t1\\nNevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master\\'s stable.  \\t1\\nI have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  \\t1\\nExcellently produced by one of Sci-fi\\'s best producers Scot Vandiver !  \\t1\\nBut it is entertaining, nonetheless.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s a campy sort of film that\\'s a joy to watch.  \\t1\\nThere\\'s barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  \\t1\\nThe cast is always entertaining as usual.  \\t1\\nOverall, a delight!  \\t1\\nThis movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn\\'t have even been created.  \\t0\\nThe film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  \\t0\\nThe least said about the acting the better.  \\t0\\nThis movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  \\t1\\nI believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  \\t1\\nNothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  \\t1\\nThe acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  \\t1\\nDon\\'t be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  \\t1\\nExcellent performance.  \\t1\\nThere still are good actors around!  \\t1\\nAlso great directing and photography.  \\t1\\nVery true to Shakespear, and a \\'must\\' for all Shakespear fans.  \\t1\\nMacbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  \\t1\\nHelen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  \\t1\\nIf you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  \\t1\\nThis is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA\\'s finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  \\t1\\nSpecial mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  \\t1\\nHowever Paul Schrader has indeed made a film about Mishima that is both superb & complex.  \\t1\\nAlso notable is John Bailey\\'s fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola\\'s Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  \\t1\\nEven allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  \\t0\\nUnless you\\'re just out to visually collect all extant films of Austen\\'s work, you can skip this one.  \\t0\\nIf you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne\\'s sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  \\t1\\nIt is not good.  \\t0\\nSpeaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  \\t0\\nThen the film just dropped the ball.  \\t0\\nThis is a stunning movie.  \\t1\\nRaw and sublimely moving.  \\t1\\nIt felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone\\'s terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  \\t1\\nAll of the main players are mesmerising.  \\t1\\nTom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else\\'s judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  \\t1\\nJulian Fellowes has triumphed again.  \\t1\\nHe\\'s a national treasure.  \\t1\\nGO AND SEE IT!  \\t1\\nThis is an excellent film.  \\t1\\nThe aerial scenes were well-done.  \\t1\\nIt was also the right balance of war and love.  \\t1\\nThe film gives meaning to the phrase, Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  \\t1\\nKris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  \\t1\\nA good film by a great director!  \\t1\\nThis is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  \\t1\\nThere are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe\\'s glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe\\'s facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  \\t0\\nThis is just a great movie.  \\t1\\n10 out of 10 stars.  \\t1\\nI can\\'t see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  \\t0\\nIt\\'s so bad it\\'s actually worth seeing just for that reason.  \\t0\\nPunishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  \\t1\\nShot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.  \\t1\\nThis is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  \\t1\\nI advise you to look out for it.  \\t1\\nYou wont regret it!  \\t1\\nHighly recommended A+  \\t1\\nWell... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  \\t0\\nIt\\'s a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  \\t0\\nIt\\'s a case of \\'so bad it is laughable\\'.  \\t0\\n) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  \\t0\\nIt is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  \\t0\\nHow awful she is!  \\t0\\nBut she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  \\t0\\nThe results, well, are a shame.  \\t0\\nDELETE this film from your mind!  \\t0\\nOne of the worst shows of all time.  \\t0\\nThe show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  \\t0\\nThe fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  \\t0\\nNever heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  \\t0\\nEvery time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, you see kids... Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  \\t0\\nThe stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  \\t0\\nLame would be the best way to describe it.  \\t0\\nStanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens\\' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  \\t1\\nThe success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  \\t1\\nThe attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  \\t1\\nIm big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  \\t0\\nThe lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  \\t0\\nYou can find better movies at youtube.  \\t0\\nTop line: Don\\'t waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.  \\t0\\nA Lassie movie which should have been put to sleep.... FOREVER.  \\t0\\nThat\\'s how I\\'d describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  \\t0\\nSo mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I\\'ve seen.  \\t0\\nIt isn\\'t even an achievement as a so-bad-it\\'s-good or so-bad-it\\'s-memorable movie.  \\t0\\nIt\\'s an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  \\t0\\nSeriously, it\\'s not worth wasting your, or your kid\\'s time on.  \\t0\\nAvoid, avoid, avoid!  \\t0\\nIt will drive you barking mad!  \\t0\\nThe transfers are very good.  \\t1\\nVery nice and relaxing late night viewing.  \\t1\\nThe movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  \\t1\\n) some great music, and terrific scenery.  \\t1\\nIt handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!  \\t1\\n) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!  \\t1\\nThe point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  \\t1\\nNothing new there.  \\t0\\nThat was done in the second movie.  \\t0\\nThe movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  \\t0\\nThe plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  \\t0\\nWhat on earth is Irons doing in this film?  \\t0\\nI just saw this film and I recommend it.  \\t1\\nIt has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  \\t1\\nA very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  \\t1\\nTom Wilkinson\\'s character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character\\'s anguish and suffering.  \\t1\\nEmily Watson\\'s character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  \\t1\\nDespite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  \\t1\\nIn fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise\\'s attempt.  \\t1\\nAailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  \\t1\\nI\\'m a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice\\'s style, sensitivities and treatments.  \\t1\\nI guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  \\t1\\nThe football scenes at the end were perplexing.  \\t0\\nBut I thought his acting was skilled.  \\t1\\nMeredith M was better than all right.  \\t1\\nA very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  \\t1\\nIt is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn\\'t fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  \\t1\\nNine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  \\t1\\nThis early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  \\t1\\nThis is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70\\'s.  \\t1\\nA standout scene.  \\t1\\nThis scene is very strong and unpleasant.  \\t0\\nTechnically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it\\'s coming from a distant hill.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  \\t1\\nThe movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  \\t1\\nI liked the way Dustin Hoffman\\'s character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  \\t1\\nThis movie is also revealing.  \\t1\\nPersonally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  \\t1\\nAnd it was boring.  \\t0\\nI am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  \\t0\\nPS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  \\t1\\nAn Italian reviewer called this a small, great film, and that\\'s right.  \\t1\\nAll the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  \\t1\\nYou learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  \\t1\\nThe movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating.  \\t1\\nAlso the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I\\'ve ever heard.  \\t1\\nYou won\\'t forget this movie!  \\t1\\nWhy was this film made?  \\t0\\nThe film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  \\t0\\nThe result is a film that just don\\'t look right.  \\t0\\nNone of them are engaging or exciting.  \\t0\\nThe plot is nonsense that doesn\\'t interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  \\t0\\nThe Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  \\t0\\nI saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was The Stranger and I loved it.  \\t1\\nBut the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut\\'s biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  \\t1\\nThis movie is so awesome!  \\t1\\nI loved it, it was really scary.  \\t1\\nI love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  \\t1\\nIf you want a real scare rent this one!  \\t1\\n10/10  \\t1\\nThis is an extraordinary film.  \\t1\\nAs a courtroom drama, it\\'s compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it\\'s frightening.  \\t1\\nThis film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it\\'s not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  \\t1\\nThe film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I\\'ve seen.  \\t1\\nThis mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  \\t1\\nPredictable, but not a bad watch.  \\t1\\nIt was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  \\t1\\nShe carries the movie well.  \\t1\\nConstantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  \\t1\\nIt is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  \\t1\\nHow this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it\\'s ALL wrong.  \\t0\\nIn fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  \\t0\\nAvoid at ALL costs!  \\t0\\nStar Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  \\t0\\nThe acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  \\t0\\nThe attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen\\'t bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn\\'t care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  \\t0\\nThe only place good for this film is in the garbage.  \\t0\\nThe worst one of the series.  \\t0\\nEditing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  \\t1\\nWhen a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams\\' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  \\t1\\nCinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  \\t1\\nOf course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  \\t1\\nThis film offers many delights and surprises.  \\t1\\nWhen Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from Don Giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  \\t1\\nThe story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  \\t1\\nYou share General Loewenhielm\\'s exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  \\t1\\nBut this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  \\t1\\nThe warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  \\t1\\nYou will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  \\t1\\nThe acting, as you\\'d expect from this cast, is top notch.  \\t1\\nThe characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  \\t1\\nAngus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  \\t1\\nConclusion - I loved it.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  \\t1\\nI struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  \\t1\\nMark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  \\t1\\nThe film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn\\'t insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  \\t1\\nPlus, with the movie\\'s rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  \\t1\\nJuano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  \\t1\\nTrumbull on I LOVE LUCY).  \\t1\\nSee it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.  \\t1\\nSee both films if you can.  \\t1\\nIt was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce\\'s acclaimed novella The Dead.  \\t1\\nFeelings, thoughts...Gabriel\\'s discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer\\'s grasp in Huston\\'s portrayal.  \\t1\\nVery disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  \\t0\\nIt\\'s very slow.  \\t0\\nLot of holes in the plot: there\\'s nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  \\t0\\n) Don\\'t waste your time.  \\t0\\nEnd of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I\\'ve ever seen.  \\t0\\nHe surely doesn\\'t know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  \\t0\\nThis was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  \\t0\\nI\\'m still trying to get over how bad it was.  \\t0\\nThis movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  \\t1\\nIt has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you\\'re looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  \\t1\\n With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can\\'t recommend this movie enough.  \\t1\\nCall me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  \\t1\\nGreat character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  \\t1\\n1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  \\t0\\nLots of holes in the script.  \\t0\\nIt\\'s like a bad two hour TV movie.  \\t0\\nNow imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  \\t0\\nThe dialogue is atrocious.  \\t0\\nThe acting is beyond abysmal.  \\t0\\nEverything stinks.  \\t0\\nTrouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  \\t0\\nWorse, there\\'s an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who\\'s working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  \\t0\\nIt\\'s dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  \\t0\\nIn short, don\\'t bother with this movie.  \\t0\\nI won\\'t spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  \\t1\\nThe best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won\\'t spoil it.  \\t1\\nIf there was ever an indication of a writer and a director\\'s ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  \\t1\\nThe result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture\\'s disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it\\'s distorted interpretations of fame.  \\t1\\nA film not easily forgotten.  \\t1\\nBut, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor.  \\t1\\nThe scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  \\t1\\nThe characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  \\t1\\nHighly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  \\t1\\nGreat movie!  \\t1\\nAlso the story and acting were weak.  \\t0\\nAt around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn\\'t.  \\t0\\nEither way, it sucks.  \\t0\\nThe script is horrendously stupid.  \\t0\\nThe story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  \\t0\\nEverything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  \\t0\\nWhat the hell kind of crap is that?!  \\t0\\nThen, there\\'s the plot holes.  \\t0\\nYou could drive a semi truck into these holes!  \\t0\\nLinda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  \\t1\\nShe\\'s poised and amazing.  \\t1\\nDee Snider just plain sucks.  \\t0\\nHe can\\'t act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can\\'t write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  \\t0\\nI was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  \\t0\\nThe acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  \\t0\\nThis film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  \\t0\\nThis is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  \\t0\\nA piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  \\t0\\nAvoid at any and all costs.  \\t0\\nAt any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  \\t0\\nAvoid this film at all costs.  \\t0\\nI don\\'t know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  \\t0\\nThe only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  \\t0\\nNow this is a movie I really dislike.  \\t0\\nIt\\'s one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90\\'s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  \\t0\\nThe puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80\\'s flicks.  \\t0\\nThe story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  \\t0\\nThere aren\\'t death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  \\t0\\nI felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  \\t0\\nThe fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  \\t1\\nThe best part about Nurse Betty is it\\'s unpredictability.  \\t1\\nDirector Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  \\t1\\nOtherwise, don\\'t even waste your time on this.  \\t0\\nThis one just fails to create any real suspense.  \\t0\\nAs for the killer, don\\'t expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  \\t0\\nThere is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  \\t1\\nI\\'m so sorry but I really can\\'t recommend it to anyone.  \\t0\\nOne of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  \\t0\\nThe secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  \\t0\\nHated it.  \\t0\\nThis is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  \\t0\\nI don\\'t understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it\\'s not even a real movie!  \\t0\\nI highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  \\t0\\nThis is not movie-making.  \\t0\\nThe acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that\\'s how bad it is.  \\t0\\nSo I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  \\t0\\nI saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  \\t1\\nI didn\\'t realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  \\t1\\nExcellent short film.  \\t1\\nHopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  \\t1\\nI agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  \\t0\\nCharacters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  \\t0\\nThe story line is totally predictable.  \\t0\\nNot much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  \\t1\\nI\\'ve seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  \\t0\\nBad characters, bad story and bad acting.  \\t0\\nReally awful.  \\t0\\nNot easy to watch.  \\t0\\nFunny, clever, hip - just like Pray\\'s previous film, Hype!  \\t1\\nIt was a long time that i didn\\'t see a so charismatic actor on screen.  \\t1\\nPaolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  \\t1\\nThe movie is not completely perfect but \\'Titta Di Girolamo\\' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  \\t1\\nI rate this movie 9/10.  \\t1\\nI do not know if this was Emilio Estevez\\'s directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  \\t1\\nThe interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  \\t1\\nKathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in At Play In The Fields Of The Lord.  \\t1\\nFor readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki\\'s films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  \\t1\\nIt never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  \\t1\\nThe two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  \\t1\\nThey are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  \\t1\\nThis movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  \\t1\\nThe scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  \\t1\\nThe story is also both funny and poignant at times.  \\t1\\nPeople who like European films and art movies will like this movie.  \\t1\\nThis is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  \\t1\\nGo rent it.  \\t1\\nHowever, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it\\'s meanings.  \\t1\\nBrilliance indeed.  \\t1\\nBut if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you\\'ll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  \\t1\\nThink of the film being like a dream.  \\t1\\nSimply beautiful.  \\t1\\nBoth Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens\\' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  \\t1\\nIt presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  \\t1\\nJust whatever you do, avoid Groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  \\t0\\nIt\\'s too bad that everyone else involved didn\\'t share Crowe\\'s level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we\\'d have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  \\t0\\nThe movie seemed a little slow at first.  \\t0\\nBut it picked up speed and got right to the point.  \\t1\\nIt showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget.  \\t1\\nI enjoyed it.  \\t1\\nI have recommended it to friends.  \\t1\\nI was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  \\t1\\nBoth actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  \\t1\\nTheir on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  \\t1\\nThe film\\'s dialogue is natural, real to life.  \\t1\\nThe writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  \\t1\\nThe incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  \\t1\\nEach track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  \\t1\\nDefinitely worth seeingÂ… it\\'s the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  \\t1\\nHayao Miyazaki\\'s latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, Gake No Ue No Ponyo (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  \\t1\\nAt a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar\\'s CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  \\t1\\nEnough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  \\t1\\nThe art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  \\t1\\nIf you act in such a film, you should be glad that you\\'re gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  \\t0\\nThis one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  \\t0\\nIf you haven\\'t choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you\\'ve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  \\t0\\nStill, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  \\t1\\nJust consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  \\t1\\nInstead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  \\t0\\nThen I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  \\t1\\nIt is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  \\t1\\nJudith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  \\t1\\nI keep watching it over and over.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s a sad movie, but very good.  \\t1\\nIf you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  \\t1\\nShe is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  \\t1\\nStill it\\'s quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  \\t1\\n;) Recommend with confidence!  \\t1\\nThis movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  \\t1\\nIt was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients\\' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  \\t1\\n:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  \\t1\\nThe opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  \\t1\\nFans of the genre will be in heaven.  \\t1\\nLange had become a great actress.  \\t1\\nIt looked like a wonderful story.  \\t1\\nI never walked out of a movie faster.  \\t0\\nI just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  \\t0\\nUnfortunately, any virtue in this film\\'s production work was lost on a regrettable script.  \\t0\\nIn a word, it is embarrassing.  \\t0\\nExceptionally bad!  \\t0\\nAll in all its an insult to one\\'s intelligence and a huge waste of money.  \\t0\\n\\nSo there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter.\\t0\\nGood case, Excellent value.\\t1\\nGreat for the jawbone.\\t1\\nTied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!\\t0\\nThe mic is great.\\t1\\nI have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.\\t0\\nIf you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.\\t0\\nIf you are Razr owner...you must have this!\\t1\\nNeedless to say, I wasted my money.\\t0\\nWhat a waste of money and time!.\\t0\\nAnd the sound quality is great.\\t1\\nHe was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.\\t1\\nIf the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.\\t0\\nVery good quality though\\t1\\nThe design is very odd, as the ear \"clip\" is not very comfortable at all.\\t0\\nHighly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.\\t1\\nI advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!\\t0\\nSo Far So Good!.\\t1\\nWorks great!.\\t1\\nIt clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.\\t0\\nI went on Motorola\\'s website and followed all directions, but could not get it to pair again.\\t0\\nI bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!\\t1\\nThe commercials are the most misleading.\\t0\\nI have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that\\'s three days without charging.\\t1\\nI bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.\\t0\\nGreat Pocket PC / phone combination.\\t1\\nI\\'ve owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it\\'s the best mobile phone I\\'ve had.\\t1\\nI didn\\'t think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.\\t0\\nPeople couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.\\t0\\nDoesn\\'t hold charge.\\t0\\nThis is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.\\t0\\nThis product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.\\t1\\nIt is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.\\t0\\nI have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.\\t0\\nCar charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended\\t1\\nYou need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.\\t0\\nIt has kept up very well.\\t1\\nPoor Talk Time Performance.\\t0\\nThe case is great and works fine with the 680.\\t1\\nworthless product.\\t0\\nIt has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.\\t1\\nI was not impressed by this product.\\t0\\nNice headset priced right.\\t1\\nI only hear garbage for audio.\\t0\\nExcellent bluetooth headset.\\t1\\nIt has all the features I want\\t1\\nWho in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?.\\t0\\nAFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.\\t0\\nThis case seems well made.\\t1\\nDisappointed with battery.\\t0\\nNot loud enough and doesn\\'t turn on like it should.\\t0\\ngood protection and does not make phone too bulky.\\t1\\nA usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.\\t1\\nThis phone is pretty sturdy and I\\'ve never had any large problems with it.\\t1\\nI love this thing!\\t1\\nEverything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.\\t1\\nVERY DISAPPOINTED.\\t0\\nI even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!\\t1\\nI have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.\\t1\\nThe buttons for on and off are bad.\\t0\\nEssentially you can forget Microsoft\\'s tech support.\\t0\\nI really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool.\\t1\\nThese headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I\\'ve made in the last several years - seriously.\\t1\\nBuy a different phone - but not this.\\t0\\nYou have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.\\t0\\nThe one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone\\'s front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.\\t0\\nA week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.\\t0\\nIt feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.\\t1\\nGreat for iPODs too.\\t1\\nThis device is great in several situations:1.)\\t1\\nMic Doesn\\'t work.\\t0\\nEven in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet, I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying.\\t0\\nGreat choice!\\t1\\nNice docking station for home or work.\\t1\\nThis is a beautiful phone.\\t1\\nLove this product.\\t1\\nDo Not Buy for D807...wrongly advertised for D807.\\t0\\nThis is a great little item.\\t1\\nI love this phone , It is very handy and has a lot of features .\\t1\\nI purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!!\\t0\\nI wear it everyday and it holds up very well.\\t1\\nNot a good bargain.\\t0\\nWell packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended.\\t1\\nThe battery runs down quickly.\\t0\\nThis item worked great, but it broke after 6 months of use.\\t0\\nThe headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.\\t1\\nThis phone works great.\\t1\\nThe construction of the headsets is poor.\\t0\\nProduct was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!\\t1\\nThe phone loads super!\\t1\\nFor a product that costs as much as this one does, I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does.\\t0\\nMade very sturdy.\\t1\\nWorked great!.\\t1\\nThe ear buds only play music in one ear.\\t0\\nDont waste your money...\\t0\\nWill order from them again!\\t1\\nIf you plan to use this in a car forget about it.\\t0\\nI found this product to be waaay too big.\\t0\\nBest I\\'ve found so far .... I\\'ve tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.\\t1\\nI\\'m very disappointed with my decision.\\t0\\nIntegrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.\\t1\\nBuyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.\\t0\\nDefinitely a bargain.\\t1\\nThe price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.\\t1\\nI received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.\\t0\\nPros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more.\\t1\\nThat\\'s a huge design flaw (unless I\\'m not using it correctly, which I don\\'t think is the case).\\t0\\nI love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.\\t1\\nThe camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.\\t0\\nI purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.\\t0\\nSound quality on both end is excellent, I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2.\\t1\\nThis phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful.\\t1\\nits a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.\\t1\\nGreat product, fast shipping!.\\t1\\nAbsolutely great.\\t1\\nThe keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.\\t1\\ni got this phone around the end of may and i\\'m completely unhappy with it.\\t0\\nIt is very comfortable on the ear.\\t1\\nIt has been a winner for us.\\t1\\n)Setup couldn\\'t have been simpler.\\t1\\nI\\'ve tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I\\'ve found that fits my ear comfortably.\\t1\\nCould not get strong enough signal.\\t0\\nIam very pleased with my purchase.\\t1\\nBad Quality.\\t0\\nGets the job done.\\t1\\nGreat audio!.\\t1\\nBasically the service was very bad.\\t0\\nit did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.\\t0\\nI\\'ve only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it.\\t1\\nThe BT headset was such a disapoinment.\\t0\\nIt is so small and you don\\'t even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.\\t1\\nThe accompanied software is almost brilliant.\\t1\\nHeadset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.\\t1\\n!I definitly recommend!!\\t1\\nBuyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!.\\t0\\nThe majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.\\t0\\nVery good stuff for the price.\\t1\\nMy headset works just peachy-keen.\\t1\\nIn my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.\\t0\\nVoice recognition is tremendous!\\t1\\nWhat a waste.\\t0\\nDuring several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.\\t0\\nI was not happy with this item.\\t0\\nvery disappointed.\\t0\\nThe phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.\\t0\\nI got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I\\'m glad I did.\\t1\\nWhat a waste of time!\\t0\\nIts reception is very very poor.\\t0\\nItems stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.\\t0\\nAfter 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.\\t0\\nI Was Hoping for More.\\t0\\nAudio Quality is poor, very poor.\\t0\\nI had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!\\t1\\nI know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn\\'t work well.Well, this one works great.\\t1\\nI\\'ve bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.\\t0\\nThis phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.\\t1\\nNice quality build, unlike some cheap s*** out there.\\t1\\nThis item is fantastic and works perfectly!\\t1\\nAnd I just love the colors!\\t1\\nW810i is just SUPERB.\\t1\\nAll I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.\\t0\\nGreat charger.\\t1\\nThis is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.\\t0\\nWorks like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.\\t1\\nI still maintain that monkeys shouldn\\'t make headphones, we just obviously don\\'t share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.\\t0\\nGreat Value.\\t1\\nDoesn\\'t work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.\\t0\\nThe look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics.\\t1\\ndoesn\\'t last long.\\t0\\nOne thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.\\t0\\nEXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.\\t1\\nThank you for wasting my money.\\t0\\nHow can that be?The audio quality is poor.\\t0\\nThe iGo chargers and tips are really great.\\t1\\nThe file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great.\\t1\\nSuperb Phone on a Great Network.\\t1\\nI connected my wife\\'s bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case.\\t1\\nI put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.\\t0\\nIt only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.\\t0\\nIf you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!\\t0\\nDon\\'t buy this product.\\t0\\nI\\'ve had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.\\t0\\nThe sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.\\t1\\nI have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it.\\t0\\nI recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.\\t0\\nIncredible!.\\t1\\nDesign Flaw?.\\t0\\nGreat phone!.\\t1\\nWaste of 13 bucks.\\t0\\nBut when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I\\'m lost.\\t0\\nThe replacement died in a few weeks.\\t0\\nAny ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..\\t1\\nLately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.\\t1\\nI have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more.\\t0\\nNot impressed.\\t0\\nLight weight, I hardly notice it is there.\\t1\\nYou\\'ll love how thin it is.\\t1\\nBad Choice.\\t0\\nThe pleather case doesn\\'t fit.\\t0\\nuseless phone, simply deaf.\\t0\\nThe color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp.\\t1\\nAll in all I think it was a good investment.\\t1\\nIt makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.\\t0\\nThe best electronics of the available FM Transmitters.\\t1\\nBattery lasts only a few hours.\\t0\\ngreat headset, very impressed -

If I could give this zero stars I would.\\t0\\nTrying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.\\t0\\nThe case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.\\t0\\nI own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.\\t1\\nI love the camera, it\\'s really pretty good quality.\\t1\\nThank you for such great service.\\t1\\nIts a total package.\\t1\\nThe seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.\\t1\\nI give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.\\t0\\nIt\\'s AGGRAVATING!\\t0\\nGreat product for the price!.\\t1\\nI have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use\\t1\\nVirgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!\\t1\\nNone of it works, just don\\'t buy it.\\t0\\nMuddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire\\'s insert was poorly super glued and slid off.\\t0\\nPlease dont waste your money.\\t0\\nAll in all, I\\'m quite satisfied with this purchase.\\t1\\nIf you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn\\'t it.\\t0\\nYet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.\\t0\\nDisapointing Results.\\t0\\nCumbersome design.\\t0\\nGreat it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!\\t1\\nGreat Product.\\t1\\nIt\\'s A PIECE OF CRAP!\\t0\\nMy experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!\\t0\\nThis fixes all the problems.\\t1\\nWorst ever.\\t0\\nI am very happy\\t1\\nI\\'ve had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.\\t1\\nI can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying \"what?\"\\t0\\nThe battery life is highly unacceptable.\\t0\\nThat company is a joke.\\t0\\nIt does everything the description said it would.\\t1\\nDue to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.\\t0\\nIt works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.\\t1\\nVerizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.\\t0\\nVoice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.\\t0\\nIt plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it\\'s not.\\t1\\nBetter than expected.\\t1\\nIt feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.\\t0\\nBattery is holding up well.\\t1\\nAlso difficult to put on.I\\'d recommend avoiding this product.\\t0\\nI only used it two days, and it wasn\\'t always easy to hear with.\\t0\\nI got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.\\t0\\nSprint - terrible customer service.\\t0\\nLinked to my phone without effort.\\t1\\nTHey are so cool!\\t1\\nEasy to use.\\t1\\nBetter Than New.\\t1\\nWhat possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...\\t0\\nPiece of trash.\\t0\\nA pretty good product.\\t1\\nThis is a great phone!.\\t1\\nFor the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.\\t1\\nTheir Research and Development division obviously knows what they\\'re doing.\\t1\\nThe real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.\\t0\\nThose phones are working just fine now.\\t1\\nI am more than happy with this product.\\t1\\nPoor Construction.\\t0\\nThis is infuriating.\\t0\\nOverall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.\\t1\\nSprint charges for this service.\\t0\\nIt is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.\\t0\\nIt fits my ear well and is comfortable on.\\t1\\nIt doesn\\'t work in Europe or Asia.\\t0\\nclipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent\\'s up-and-coming.\\t1\\nI like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.\\t1\\nI was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.\\t1\\nthe worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.\\t0\\nthe charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.\\t0\\nPoor product.\\t0\\nHowever I needed some better instructions.\\t0\\nYou need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.\\t0\\nWorked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).\\t1\\nSteer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.\\t0\\nDO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS\\t0\\nThis is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.\\t1\\nPlus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.\\t0\\nAll the other cases I\\'ve tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.\\t1\\nVery Dissapointing Performance.\\t0\\nDon\\'t make the same mistake that I did and please don\\'t buy this phone.\\t0\\nThis phone might well be the worst I\\'ve ever had in any brand.\\t0\\nCase was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.\\t0\\nI recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.\\t1\\nDon\\'t bother - go to the store.\\t0\\nI posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it\\'s a great color!\\t1\\nI did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.\\t1\\nYou get what you pay for I guess.\\t0\\nNot only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.\\t1\\nim surprised this is a good quality car charger and there\\'s not much reviews about it.\\t1\\nThese are fabulous!\\t1\\nHowever, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.\\t0\\nI used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.\\t1\\nDisappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.\\t0\\nPerformed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.\\t0\\nVery wind-resistant.\\t1\\nObviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.\\t0\\nThey do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.\\t1\\nI contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn\\'t produce my receipt I was out of luck.\\t0\\nLinksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!\\t0\\nPhone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.\\t1\\nGreat phone.\\t1\\nWhen I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.\\t0\\nI\\'m pleased.\\t1\\nBattery is terrible.\\t0\\nI found the product to be easy to set up and use.\\t1\\nThe earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.\\t0\\nUtter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.\\t0\\nThe charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.\\t0\\nNo ear loop needed, it\\'s tiny and the sound is great.\\t1\\nFinally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.\\t0\\nThe handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.\\t1\\nTalk about USELESS customer service.\\t0\\nIt felt too light and \"tinny.\".\\t0\\nThis does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.\\t0\\nI\\'m happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.\\t1\\nI love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.\\t1\\nIts well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.\\t1\\nDoes everything it should and more.\\t1\\nI could not recommend these more.\\t0\\nNice Sound.\\t1\\nLooks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!\\t0\\nMuch less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.\\t1\\nSetup went very smoothly.\\t1\\nits extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.\\t0\\nA must study for anyone interested in the \"worst sins\" of industrial design.\\t0\\nThe first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.\\t0\\nIt is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.\\t1\\nThen I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.\\t0\\nCan\\'t upload ringtones from a third party.\\t0\\nBluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.\\t0\\nTruly awful.\\t0\\nIt works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.\\t1\\nThe volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).\\t1\\nAnd none of the tones is acceptable.\\t0\\ncamera color balance is AWFUL.\\t0\\nThis product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don\\'t care how cool it looks, if you can\\'t tell a call is coming in it\\'s worthless.\\t0\\nI love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!\\t1\\nChinese Forgeries Abound!.\\t0\\nEasy to pair with my Samsung Cell.\\t1\\nThe instructions didn\\'t explain that a microphone jack could be used.\\t0\\ni would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.\\t0\\nToo bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!\\t0\\nWorks well.\\t1\\nThe nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.\\t0\\nClear crisp sound.\\t1\\nI have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.\\t1\\nThe biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.\\t0\\nThe design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.\\t0\\nDo NOT buy if you want to use the holster.\\t0\\nThe phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.\\t1\\nIt doesn\\'t make you look cool.\\t0\\nBecause both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.\\t1\\nComfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.\\t1\\nAlso, the phone doesn\\'t seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.\\t0\\nYou can\\'t beat the price on these.\\t1\\n* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!\\t1\\nlightweight and works well.\\t1\\nSo just beware.\\t0\\nI love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.\\t1\\nSo anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.\\t0\\nThis is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.\\t1\\nI bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.\\t0\\nAppears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.\\t1\\nCan\\'t store anything but phone numbers to SIM.\\t0\\nIt lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.\\t0\\nPoor quality.\\t0\\njabra ear gels \"R\" the best!.\\t1\\nNot worth it.\\t0\\nThe phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.\\t0\\nIt quit working after I\\'d used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I\\'ve ever owned.\\t1\\nUnfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).\\t0\\nIt was a great phone.\\t1\\nif you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.\\t0\\nGood value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.\\t1\\nMy phone doesn\\'t slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.\\t1\\nThis is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!\\t1\\nThink it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!\\t0\\nIn the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim \"Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?\\t1\\nI have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.\\t1\\nThis case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.\\t1\\nOther than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.\\t1\\nIt has everything I need and I couldn\\'t ask for more.\\t1\\nAfter receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.\\t0\\nThis product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.\\t1\\nNone of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.\\t0\\nT-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.\\t1\\nArrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.\\t1\\nWe have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros\\t0\\nProvides good protection and looks classy, too.\\t1\\nKrussel Always good.\\t1\\nThe tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc.\\t1\\nThe design is very good.4.\\t1\\nI great reception all the time.\\t1\\nI would highly recommend this product.\\t1\\nCouldn\\'t use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!\\t0\\nIt dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.\\t0\\nBought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.\\t0\\nIf you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!\\t0\\nFantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is\\t1\\nstay away from this store, be careful.\\t0\\nThis BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.\\t1\\nDoes not fit.\\t0\\n.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.\\t1\\nIt is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.\\t1\\ndisappointing.\\t0\\nBlue Ant is easy to use.\\t1\\nCheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.\\t1\\nThe camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I\\'d rather be using a disposable then this.\\t0\\nThen a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.\\t0\\nIt\\'s very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.\\t1\\nThe nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.\\t0\\nThe sound quality is excellent as well.\\t1\\nIts the best headset I have used.\\t1\\nWould not reccommend.\\t0\\nThey have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.\\t1\\nJust what I wanted.\\t1\\nThis particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.\\t0\\nwont work right or atleast for me.\\t0\\nin addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.\\t0\\nBut now that it is \"out of warranty\" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.\\t0\\nI really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good\\t0\\nGreat product.\\t1\\nCrisp and Clear.\\t1\\nAFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.\\t0\\nVERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor.\\t0\\nI get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.\\t0\\nThe reception has been generally good.\\t1\\nExcellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.\\t1\\nGreat bluetooth!.\\t1\\nI highly recommend this case.\\t1\\nWORTHWHILE.\\t1\\nThis is a great deal.\\t1\\nAfter my phone got to be about a year old, it\\'s been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.\\t0\\nI am sorry I made this purchase.\\t0\\nI bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.\\t0\\nTreo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.\\t0\\nIt was horrible!.\\t0\\nI don\\'t think it would hold it too securly on your belt.\\t0\\nThis allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.\\t0\\nThey work about 2 weeks then break.\\t0\\nIt is simple to use and I like it.\\t1\\nIt\\'s a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!\\t1\\nI can\\'t use this case because the smell is disgusting.\\t0\\nNOT WHAT I WANTED.\\t0\\nI own 2 of these cases and would order another.\\t1\\nGreat Phone.\\t1\\nI bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I\\'m very happy with my purchase.\\t1\\nThe internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.\\t0\\nPerfect for the PS3.\\t1\\nFive star Plus, plus.\\t1\\nA good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn\\'t hear me.\\t1\\n$50 Down the drain.\\t0\\nI tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn\\'t great.\\t0\\nGood , works fine.\\t1\\nFor the price this was a great deal.\\t1\\nGreat price, too!\\t1\\nIf there is a wind, it is completely useless.\\t0\\nYes it\\'s shiny on front side - and I love it!\\t1\\nDoes Not Work.\\t0\\nAt first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).\\t0\\nThe reception through this headset is excellent.\\t1\\n2 thumbs up to this seller\\t1\\nI have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.\\t1\\nImproper description.... I had to return it.\\t0\\n#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.\\t1\\nBattery charge-life is quite long.\\t1\\nThe Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.\\t1\\nBattery has no life.\\t0\\nI checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.\\t0\\nProduct is exactly as described.\\t1\\nGets a signal when other Verizon phones won\\'t.\\t1\\nDoesn\\'t do the job.\\t0\\nI would recommend it.\\t1\\nPlan on ordering from them again and again.\\t1\\nThat being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.\\t1\\nI have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.\\t1\\nThey keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I\\'ve had numerous Palms too).\\t1\\nAwkward to use and unreliable.\\t0\\nThe shipping time was also very quick!\\t1\\nNot as good as I had hoped.\\t0\\nGood case!.\\t1\\nDoesn\\'t Work.\\t0\\nReally good product.\\t1\\nUnfortunately it did not work.\\t0\\nAll three broke within two months of use.\\t0\\ndont buy it.\\t0\\nMy father has the V265, and the battery is dying.\\t0\\nHowever, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.\\t0\\nThe calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.\\t0\\nHorrible, horrible protector.\\t0\\nI don\\'t like this Nokia either.\\t0\\nReaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.\\t0\\nI have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.\\t0\\nIt would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.\\t0\\nthe only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!\\t0\\nTerrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.\\t0\\nProduct is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.\\t0\\nIt\\'s not what it says it is.\\t0\\nStay Away From the Q!.\\t0\\nUsed and dirty.\\t0\\nVery unreliable service from T-mobile !\\t0\\nNot good enough for the price.\\t0\\nI bought two of them and neither will charge.\\t0\\nIt looks very nice.\\t1\\nThis is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone\\'s auto-answer.\\t1\\nI have read other\\'s reviews here but I haven\\'t had any problem with it.\\t1\\nThese products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.\\t0\\nComfortable in my hand.\\t1\\nJust does not work.\\t0\\nPoor Reliability.\\t0\\n(It works!)\\t1\\nIf I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.\\t0\\nTerrible product, and waste of money!\\t0\\nLast time buying from you.\\t0\\nIt was a waste of my money.\\t0\\nSo far it has worked like a charm.\\t1\\nI have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.\\t1\\nBut, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.\\t1\\nWould recommend this item.\\t1\\nIt\\'s been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.\\t1\\nNice case, feels good in your hands.\\t1\\nThe item received was Counterfeit.\\t0\\nJust really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had.\\t1\\nWorks fine.\\t1\\nI received my headset in good time and was happy with it.\\t1\\nI was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.\\t1\\nMy sister has one also and she loves it.\\t1\\nGood Quality.\\t1\\nThis is by far the worst purchase I\\'ve made on Amazon.\\t0\\nExcellent dual-purpose headset.\\t1\\nExcellent!.\\t1\\nDoes not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.\\t0\\nIt seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.\\t1\\nThe bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.\\t0\\nHaving trouble with volume.\\t0\\nThe only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.\\t1\\nWARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.\\t0\\nI am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far.\\t1\\nWhen it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.\\t0\\nI didn\\'t want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.\\t0\\nBest headset ever!!!.\\t1\\nDon\\'t trust their website and don\\'t expect any helpful support.\\t0\\nIt was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.\\t1\\nThe speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.\\t0\\nFits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.\\t1\\nExcellent product for the price.\\t1\\nBad Reception.\\t0\\nThis product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!\\t0\\nIt was quite comfortable in the ear.\\t1\\nGreat phone.\\t1\\nDon\\'t buy this product - It fails!.\\t0\\nEverything about this product is wrong.First\\t0\\nThe pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.\\t1\\nThis was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.\\t0\\nTerrible phone holder.\\t0\\nThe cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.\\t1\\nI love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.\\t1\\nProblem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.\\t0\\nNot nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.\\t0\\nBut despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.\\t1\\nHow stupid is that?\\t0\\nI can hear while I\\'m driving in the car, and usually don\\'t even have to put it on it\\'s loudest setting.\\t1\\nSeller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.\\t1\\nGood show, Samsung.\\t1\\nSo I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.\\t1\\nIt always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.\\t0\\nCouldn\\'t figure it out\\t0\\nMy phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife\\'s phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn\\'t understand a word being said on it.\\t0\\nSo I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.\\t0\\nWhile I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.\\t0\\nLeopard Print is wonderfully wild!.\\t1\\nWorks for me.\\t1\\nSaggy, floppy piece of junk.\\t0\\nmuch better than the hard plastic cases.\\t1\\nIt also had a new problem.\\t0\\nHappy so far!.\\t1\\ncool phone.\\t1\\nWorks good.\\t1\\nMotorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.\\t1\\nIt looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.\\t0\\nbut it is great, i would really recommend it\\t1\\nMakes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I\\'m not wearing it.\\t0\\nAs I said above....PRETTY USELESS!\\t0\\nNever got it!!!!!\\t0\\nThis pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.\\t0\\n[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!\\t0\\nDoes not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.\\t0\\nYou get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off.\"\\t1\\nHowever, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn\\'t receive and place calls.\\t0\\nI kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.\\t0\\nThe headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.\\t1\\nLogitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.\\t1\\nI like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.\\t1\\nA lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.\\t1\\nI have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.\\t1\\nThe mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.\\t0\\nI\\'m returning them.\\t0\\nI does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.\\t0\\nIt is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.\\t1\\nI have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.\\t1\\nOtherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.\\t1\\nnice leather.\\t1\\nI had to purchase a different case.\\t0\\nIt is a joy to use.\\t1\\nVery much disappointed with this company.\\t0\\nVery satisifed with that.\\t1\\nIt didn\\'t charge for me.\\t0\\nThis is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!\\t1\\nButtons are too small.\\t0\\nJust reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.\\t1\\nLove it.. Great armband.\\t1\\nI really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.\\t1\\nHowever, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.\\t0\\nI exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I\\'m pretty happy with that decision.\\t1\\nI was very impressed with the price of the cases.\\t1\\nAlso makes it easier to hold on to.\\t1\\nI use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!\\t1\\nIt\\'s pretty easy.\\t1\\nI cannot make calls at certain places.\\t0\\nhowever, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn\\'t wake up like normal phone does.\\t0\\nBeautiful styling though.\\t1\\nThis company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.\\t0\\nI\\'m trying to return it for a refund.\\t0\\nI plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.\\t0\\nExcellent product.\\t1\\nEarbud piece breaks easily.\\t0\\nLousy product.\\t0\\nThis phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it\\'s very ability to be a phone.\\t0\\nIt is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.\\t1\\nSWEETEST PHONE!!!\\t1\\n:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.\\t1\\nIt fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.\\t1\\nNot enough volume.\\t0\\nEcho Problem....Very unsatisfactory\\t0\\nyou could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.\\t0\\ndon\\'t waste your money.\\t0\\nI am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.\\t0\\nAdapter does not provide enough charging current.\\t0\\nThere was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.\\t0\\nYou also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.\\t0\\nPhone falls out easily.\\t0\\nIt didn\\'t work, people can not hear me when I talk.\\t0\\nThe text messaging feature is really tricky to use.\\t0\\nI\\'m really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn\\'t work.\\t0\\nPainful on the ear.\\t0\\nLasted one day and then blew up.\\t0\\ndisappointed.\\t0\\nKind of flops around.\\t0\\nThe screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.\\t0\\nWhat a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.\\t0\\nItem Does Not Match Picture.\\t0\\nThe only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).\\t0\\nYou can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!\\t0\\n'"
